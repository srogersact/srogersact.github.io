      <p>Learning to analyze and compose sentences will help you to be an accurate reader and a skillful writer.</p>
      <ul>
       <li>When you <em>analyze</em> a sentence, you break it into meaningful parts.</li>
       <li>When you <em>compose</em> a sentence, you join meaningful parts together to make a complete sentence.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>You need to paraphrase, but you don't know how to "put it into your own words"? Learning to analyze and compose sentences will help you to be able to paraphrase more easily.</p>
     <h3 id="compound-sentences">Begin with Compound Sentences</h3>

     <p>Learning about compound sentences is an easy place to begin analyzing and composing sentences. </p>
     <ul>
      <li>Can you tell the difference between a complete sentence and a sentence fragment? Working with compound sentences will help you to master this important skill.</li>
      <li>Do you sometimes doze off when you try to read a long sentence? You will learn how to break <em>large</em> compound sentences into <em>smaller</em> simple sentences. <strong>Then you can just read one smaller sentence at a time!</strong></li>
      <li>You probably already know how to compose a compound sentence. You simply join two or more complete sentences with one or more comma and a conjunction. But do you ever have run-on sentences? Learning how to compose compound sentences will help.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="compound-subject-predicate-object">Compound Subject, Predicate, and Object Sentences</h3>

    <p>Sometimes sentences have a compound subject, a compound predicate, or a compound object. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oops! You don't know what <code class="highlighter-rouge">subjects</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">predicates</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">objects</code> are?  You'll get familiar with these important words just by using them.</li>
      <li>Knowing about sentences with compound subjects, compound predicates, and compound objects will help you to understand long sentences. You will learn another way to break <em>larger</em> sentences into <em>smaller</em> simpler sentences. </li>
      <li>Have you ever written a complicated sentence that ended up in a big snarl? Learning how to compose a sentence with a compound subject, a compound predicate, or a compound object will help.</li>
    </ul>
