      <p>In these pages you will learn grammar effects. The purpose is to be able to analyze and compose sentences.</p>
      <ul>
       <li>When you <em>analyze</em> a sentence, you will break it into simpler sentences.</li>
       <li>When you <em>compose</em> a sentence, you will join simple sentences together to make a more complicated sentence.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Knowing the grammar effects to analyze sentences will help you to be an accurate reader. If you know grammar effects well enough to analyze a sentence into its parts, you can see whether you understand each part of the sentence. You can tell which parts are difficult to understand and which are easy. Then you can ask specific questions to get the help you need.</p>
     <p>Knowing the grammar effects to compose sentences will help you to be a skillful writer. You can use grammar effects to write sentences that have different lengths and use different patterns. Sentence variety will keep your reader's interest. Mastering grammar effects will make you able to express more of what you would like to say.</p>
     <h3 id="compound-sentences"><span class="medium">&nbsp;First Grammar Effect:&nbsp;</span> Compound Sentences</h3>

     <p>Learning about compound sentences is a great place to begin thinking about grammar effects, because analyzing and composing compound sentences is so easy! It's practical, too:
     <ul>
      <li>Do you sometimes doze off when you try to read a long sentence? You will learn how to break <em>large</em> compound sentences into <em>smaller</em> simple sentences. Then you can just read one smaller sentence at a time!</li>

      <li>Can you tell the difference between a complete sentence and a sentence fragment? Working with compound sentences will help you to master this important skill.</li>
     
      <li>You probably already know how to compose long sentences. But do you ever have run-on sentences? Learning how to compose compound sentences will help.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="compound-subject-predicate-object"><span class="medium">&nbsp;More Easy Grammar Effects:&nbsp;</span> Compound Subject, Predicate, and Object Sentences</h3>

    <p>Sometimes sentences have compound subjects, compound predicates, or compound objects. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oops! You don't know what <code class="highlighter-rouge">subjects</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">predicates</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">objects</code> are?  They name some very common grammar effects that you already use all the time. You'll get familiar with these important words just by using them.</li>
      <li>Knowing about sentences with compound subjects, compound predicates, and compound objects will help you to understand long sentences. You will learn new ways to break <em>larger</em> sentences into <em>smaller</em> simpler sentences. </li>
      <li>Have you ever written a complicated sentence that ended up in a big snarl? Learning how to compose a sentence with a compound subject, a compound predicate, or a compound object will help.</li>
    </ul>
