<h1 class="post-title">The First Tablets</h1>


<h3>Have you ever written on a tablet? 

<br>This article tells you about a very old kind of tablet.</h3>

<p>Probably the first kind of material people wrote on was clay. <span class="tooltip">They<span class="tooltiptext">The people who did the first writing</span></span> dug it from the riverbanks where <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the people who did the first writing</span></span> lived. The people shaped the clay into flat bricks <span class="tooltip">that<span class="tooltiptext">the flat bricks</span></span> are called tablets. To write on a tablet <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the people who did the first writing</span></span> used a reed, <span class="tooltip">which<span class="tooltiptext">a reed</span></span> is a kind of tall grass <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the people who did the first writing</span></span> found nearby. The tablet had to be moist to write on <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">the tablet</span></span>. <span class="tooltip">Afterwards<span class="tooltiptext">After they wrote on the tablet</span></span> <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">the tablet</span></span> was allowed to dry and harden in the sun. <span class="tooltip">That<span class="tooltiptext">Drying and hardening in the sun</span></span> made the writing permanent unless the tablet got wet againâ€”<span class="tooltip">which<span class="tooltiptext">getting the tablet wet again</span></span> was often done on purpose. <span class="tooltip">Then<span class="tooltiptext">When the tablet was wet again</span></span> the wet clay was smoothed, the writing was erased, and the tablet was ready to be used again. </p>

<p>Luckily for <span class="tooltip">us<span class="tooltiptext">people who live in modern times</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">this<span class="tooltiptext">wetting, smoothing, and erasing the tablet</span></span> did not always happen. Archaeologists are scientists <span class="tooltip">who<span class="tooltiptext">these scientist</span></span> study ancient places. <span class="tooltip">They<span class="tooltiptext">Archaeologists</span></span> have found many clay tablets with writing on them. <span class="tooltip">Some<span class="tooltiptext">Some clay tablets</span></span> are easily broken, since <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the clay tablets that are easily broken</span></span> are just dried mud. But <span class="tooltip">others<span class="tooltiptext">other clay tablets</span></span> are very hard. <span class="tooltip"> These tablets <span class="tooltiptext">The clay tablets that are very hard</span></span> were heated to high temperatures. <span class="tooltip">That is because<span class="tooltiptext">The tablets were heated to high temperatures because</span></span> sometimes the buildings where ancient people stored <span class="tooltip">their<span class="tooltiptext">the ancient people's</span></span> tablets caught fire and burned. <span class="tooltip">This<span class="tooltiptext">The buildings catching fire and burning</span></span> was unlucky for <span class="tooltip">them<span class="tooltiptext">the ancient people</span></span> but lucky for <span class="tooltip">us<span class="tooltiptext">people who live in modern times</span></span>. <span class="tooltip">Otherwise<span class="tooltiptext">If the buildings had not caught fire and burned</span></span> few of the tablets would have lasted so long.</p>

<p>When dry clay is heated very hot, <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">the dry clay</span></span> turns into a much harder material. <span class="tooltip">This new material<span class="tooltiptext">The much harder material</span></span> will not crumble. <span class="tooltip">It<span class="tooltiptext">This new material</span></span> will not change its shape when wet. <span class="tooltip">Whatever has been written<span class="tooltiptext">Any writing that was written</span></span> on <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">this new material</span></span> will not disappear. </p>
