<!-- Introduction -->
<p>Learning about compound sentences is a great place to begin thinking about grammar effects, because analyzing and composing compound sentences is so easy! </p>

<!-- Special Note -->
<div class="defining_text">
    In this work...
    <ul>
        <li>When you <em>analyze</em> a sentence, you will break it into simple sentences.</li>
        <li>When you <em>compose</em> a sentence, you will join simple sentences together to make a more complicated sentence.</li>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing a Compound Sentence</h2>

<p>Here is a compound sentence:</p>

<p class="problem">Egypt is a country in Africa, and Greece is a country in Europe.</p>

<p>This sentence can easily be analyzed as two sentences.

    <br>You simply...
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Remove the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>. </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p class="solution">Egypt is a country in Africa. Greece is a country in Europe.</p>

<p>That is super easy, don't you think?
    <br>
    <br>Here is another very simple example:
</p>

<p class="problem">Upper Egypt is in the south, <span class="tooltip">and<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction.</span></span> Lower Egypt is in the north.</p>


<p> Again, you just...
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Remove the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>. </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Upper Egypt is in the south. Lower Egypt is in the north.</p>

<!-- Composition 1 -->
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing a Compound Sentence</h2>

<p>Here are two sentences:</p>

<p class="problem">Memphis was an important city in Egypt. Athens was an important city in Greece.</p>

<p>These sentences can easily be composed as one compound sentence. </p>
<p> Here is what you do:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the period at the end of the first sentence into a comma. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction.<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have unnecessary capitals in your sentence.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Memphis was an important city in Egypt, and Athens was an important city in Greece.</p>

<p>That is super easy, too, don't you think?</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<p class="problem">The Ionian Sea is to the west of mainland Greece. The Aegean Sea is to the east of mainland Greece.</p>

<p>These are longer sentences. Do they make you nervous? Just remember these simple directions:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the period at the end of the first sentence into a comma. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> after the comma.</li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have unnecessary capitals in your sentence.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">The Ionian Sea is to the west of mainland Greece, and the Aegean Sea is to the east of mainland Greece.</p>

<p>We changed the period to a comma.
    <br>
    <br>We added "and."
    <br>
    <br>Did you notice that we also made the "t" in "the" lowercase?

<!-- Analysis 2 -->
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing Compound Sentences with Three or More Clauses</h2>
<p>Have you ever thought about why writers even use compound sentences? Let's think about that in a little bit.</p>
<p>Sometimes a sentence has three or more <span class="tooltip">clauses.<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span>:</p>

<p class="problem">Cyprus is an island north of Egypt, Crete is an island close to mainland Greece, and Sicily is an island south of Rome.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first clause is <span class="problem_quote"> Cyprus is an island north of Egypt.</span></li>
    <li>The second clause is <span class="problem_quote"> Crete is an island close to mainland Greece.</span></li>
    <li>The third clause is <span class="problem_quote"> Sicily is an island south of Rome.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Now it is easy to see that the compound sentence was really just a list of sentences. </p>
<p>A compound sentence with three or more clauses is easy to analyze:

    <ul>
        <li>Change the commas into periods. </li>
        <li>Remove the conjunction. </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Cyprus is an island north of Egypt. Crete is an island close to mainland Greece. Sicily is an island south of Rome.</p>

<p>A sentence can also have four, five, or more sentences.
    <br>If you focus on just one of those sentences at a time, it will be easier to understand.
    <br>
</p>

<p>Now let's think about why writers use compound sentences. Did you notice anything about the three sentences that were joined together to make one sentence?
    <ul>
        <li>The first clause is about Cyprus. This clause tells us what Cyprus is (an island) and where it is located (north of Egypt).</li>
        <li>The second clause is about Crete. This clause tells us what Crete is (also an island) and where it is located (close to mainland Greece).</li>
        <li>The third clause is about Sicily. This clause tells us what Sicily is (this is an island, too!) and where it is located (south of Rome).</li>
    </ul>
    Each of the sentences is about an island. Each of the sentences tells us the same two things about a different island:
    <ol>
        <li>the name of the island, </li>
        <li>where it is located. </li>
    </ol>
    The sentences compare the three islands. <strong>Compound sentences are often used to compare.</strong>

<!-- Composition 2 -->
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing Compound Sentences with Three or More Clauses</h2>

<p>Sometimes you have three or more sentences that go together:</p>

<p class="problem">Menes founded Memphis. Theseus founded Athens. Romulus founded Rome.</p>

<p>Do you see why these sentences go together? They are comparing three people&mdash;Menes, Theseus, and Romulus. Each of these people founded a city.</p>
<p>Or the sentences are comparing three cities&mdash;Memphis, Athens, and Rome. It depends on your point of view.
</p>

<p> It is easy to compose a compound sentence using these three sentences. Here is what you do:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the periods at the ends of the sentences into commas&mdash;except for the period at the end of the very last sentence. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> before the very last sentence. </li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have capitals in the middle of your sentence if they don't need to be there.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Menes founded Memphis, Theseus founded Athens, and Romulus founded Rome.</p>

<p>Notice that we use commas where the first two periods went.</p>
<!-- Special Note -->
<div class="defining_text">
    <h3 class="defining_text">Use the Oxford Comma:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In this work you will always put a comma before the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> at the end of a list.</li>
        <li>This is what is called the <em>"Oxford comma."</em></li>
        <li>Some people prefer to leave out the Oxford comma. That's perfectly okay...</li>
    </ul>
    &#10071;&nbsp;...BUT you will have to use the Oxford comma in the "Try It Yourself" exercises.</em> Otherwise, they won't work.

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-3&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing Even Longer Compound Sentences</h2>

<p>Before we talk about this next sentence, why don't you count to see how many <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> it has.
</p>

<p class="problem">Rome is at about the same latitude as Denver, Athens is at about the same latitude as San Francisco, Alexandria is at about the same latitude as Houston, and Constantinople is at about the same latitude as Chicago.</p>

<p>Did you count two clauses? Me neither. Three clauses? Nope, neither did I. It's four clauses.</p>

<p>Look back and see whether you think each clause is difficult.</p>

<p>Here is that same sentence analyzed into four sentences:</p>

<p class="solution">Rome is at about the same latitude as Denver. Athens is at about the same latitude as San Francisco. Alexandria is at about the same latitude as Houston. Constantinople is at about the same latitude as Chicago.</p>

<p>If you read each sentence one at a time, they are pretty easy to understand. Give it a try.</p>
<p>The sentences all do the same thing: each sentence is comparing two cities. A list of similar sentences like these are often joined together to make a compound sentence. It is a very commonly used grammar effect.</p>
<p>Using this grammar effect, you can break some pretty large sentences into smaller sentences that are easier to understand.</p>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-3&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing a Compound Sentence with Four Clauses</h2>

<p>How many <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> are listed here?</p>

<p class="problem">Memphis was founded in about 3100 B.C.E. Athens was founded before 3000 B.C.E. Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. Constantinople was founded in 324 C.E.</p>

<p>Did you say four? Was that because you counted or because your read it in the C-3 heading?</p>
<p>Either way, good job!</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> is about a city and when it was founded. So all of the clauses go together. It makes sense
    to join them into a compound sentence:</p>

<p class="solution">Memphis was founded in about 3100 B.C.E., Athens was founded before 3000 B.C.E., Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E., and Constantinople was founded in 324 C.E.</p>

<p>Each of the <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> was short, but the compound sentence we made out of them has 25 words. That makes it a pretty
    long sentence.</p>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-4&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Marking a Contrast</h2>

<p>So far we have been writing compound sentences that use "and" as the conjunction. These sentences have been showing how things are similar.</p>
<p>Now we will think about compound sentences that emphasize how things are different.</p>

<p class="problem">There are many islands in the Aegean Sea, but the Ionian Sea has only a few islands.</p>

<p>This compound sentence is showing how the Aegean Sea is different from the Ionian Sea.</p>
<p>It may be easier to notice the contrast if we analyze the sentence into its clauses:</p>

<p class="solution">There are many islands in the Aegean Sea. However, the Ionian Sea has only a few islands.</p>

<p>Did you notice that word, "However"? It replaces the word, "but."</p>
<!-- Special Note -->
<div class="defining_text">
    <h3 class="defining_text">Use "However" to replace "but."</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In this work, you will not start a sentence with a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>.</li>
        <li>The words "but" and "However" are used to show contrast.</li>
        <li>Replace the word "but" with "However" at the beginning of a sentence.</li>
        <li><em>"However" always has to have a comma right after it. </em></li>
    </ul>
    &#10071;&nbsp;You will have to replace "but" with "However,..." in the "Try It Yourself" exercises.</em> Otherwise, they won't work.

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-4&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a Contrast</h2>

<p>The two sentences below make a contrast:</p>

<p class="problem">The Roman Emperor Constantine named the new capital of the Roman empire Constantinople. However, that city is now known as Istanbul.</p>

<p>The contrast is between what a certain city was named to start with and what it is called now.</p>
<!--   <p>The word "However" is used in the second sentence. Notice that it is followed by a comma.</p> -->
<p>The word "However" is used to show the contrast. If we join the two sentences, we will use "but" as the conjunction. The word "but" shows contrast.</p>

<p class="solution">The Roman Emperor Constantine named the new capital of the Roman empire Constantinople, but the city is now known as Istanbul.</p>

<p>"However" and "but" have the same grammar effect of showing contrast.
    <ul>
        <li>"However" is used at the beginning of a sentence to show contrast.</li>
        <li>The word "but" is used as a conjunction in the middle of a sentence to show contrast.</li>

<!-- Special Note about but-->
<div class="defining_text">

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-5&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing a Longer Compound Sentence</h2>

<p>This is a longer compound sentence. Does it make a contrast?</p>

<p class="problem">Earlier in their history the Egyptians were powerful and defeated many of their neighbors, but they were later defeated by the Greeks and then by the Romans. </p>

<p>You may have skipped right to the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> to see that the sentence makes a contrast. If you did, congratulations! </p>
<p>This sentence is a little longer, and it only has two clauses. Each of those clauses is longer and more complicated than the ones you have dealt with so far.</p>
<p>That's okay. We will just do the same things we've been doing:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Remove the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>, "but." </li>
        <li>Make sure the sentences start with capitals.</li>
        <li>Use "However" to replace "but."</li>
        <li>Be sure "However" has a comma right after it.</li>

</p>
<p class="solution">Earlier in their history the Egyptians were powerful and defeated many of their neighbors. However, they were later defeated by the Greeks and then by the Romans. </p>

<p>It doesn't matter that the clauses are long. You just treat them the same way you do shorter sentences and make separate sentences. Then you can focus on them one at a time.</p>
