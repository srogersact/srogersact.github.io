<h1 class="post-title">Chapter 2:  Cyrus Marches from Sardis to Tarsus</h1>

<h2>An Exerpt from <i>The Anabasis</i> by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>
<h3>§1:  The Troops are Mustered at Sardis</h3>
<p>When the time came for Cyrus to make his move, the excuse he used was that he wanted to march against the Pisidians and clear them out of his territory completely. He sent orders to his generals to gather his native troops and the Greek armies saying that their mission was against the Pisidians, and they all came pouring into Sardis. </p>

<h3>§2:  Tissaphernes Warns the King</h3>
<p>But Tissaphernes was alert to all of this. He doubted that Cyrus would need such a huge army to march against the Pisidians. So he rode off to the king as quickly as he could, taking along about five hundred horsemen. The king, on his side, had no sooner heard from Tissaphernes of Cyrus's great army, than he began to make counter-preparations.</p>
<h3>§3:  The March Through Lydia and Phrygia to Colossae and Celaenae</h3>
<p>Thus Cyrus, with the troops which I have named, set out from Sardis, and marched on and on through Lydia to the river Maeander. That river is two hundred feet wide, and was spanned by a bridge made out of seven boats. He crossed it and marched into the territory of Phrygia and arrived at the large, prosperous city of Colossae. He stayed in this city for seven days. During this time, Menon the Thessalian arrived.  He brought with him one thousand hoplites and five hundred peltasts.</p>
<p>From this place he marched to Celaenae. This is also a large and prosperous city in Phrygia.</p>
<h3>§4:  Two Palaces and the Myth of Marsyas</h3>
<p>Cyrus had a palace in Celeanae with a large park full of wild animals. He used to hunt these animals on horseback. The river Maeander flows out from under the buildings of the palace, through the middle of the park, and into the city of Celaenae.</p>
<p>At the foot of the acropolis in Celaenae is another palace.  This one is owned by the great king and is fortified. The river Marsyas flows out from under this palace, through the city, and into the Maeander. It is twenty-five feet wide. The river is named for Marsyas, a man who had a contest with Apollo. When Apollo beat Marsyas, so the story goes, he skinned him. Then he took the skin into the cavern where the river begins and hung it up. And that is how the river Marsyas got its name. According to tradition, Xerxes built the palace and the citadel of Celaenae when he retreated from Greece after losing the famous battle.</p>
<h3>§5:  A Review of the Greek Troops</h3>
<p>Cyrus stayed in Celaenae for thirty days.  He was joined by Clearchus the Spartan exile, who brought one thousand hoplites, eight hundred Thracian peltasts, and two hundred Cretan archers. Sosis from Syracuse arrived, also, with three thousand hoplites, and so did Sophaenetus the Arcadian, with one thousand hoplites. Then Cyrus reviewed his Greek troops in the park and counted them. All together there were eleven thousand hoplites and about two thousand peltasts.</p>
<h3>§6:  They Hold a Feast at Peltae Then March on Toward Mysia </h3>
<p>From Celaenae he marched to the populous city of Peltae, where he stayed three days. Here Xenias the Arcadian celebrated the Lycaea with sacrifice. As part of the festival, he organized some sports competitions with gold crowns for prizes. Cyrus himself watched the events.</p>
<p>From Peltae he marched to the populous city of Ceramon Agora (“Potter’s Market”).  This is the last city before the Mysian border.</p>
<h3>§7:  The Troops’ Pay is Late, and Queen Epyaxa Arrives</h3>
<p>From there they marched to Caystru Pedion (“Cayster Plain”), also a populous city. Cyrus halted here for five days.  By this time the soldiers’ pay was more than three months late, and they came many times to the door of his tent to demand their money. Although Cyrus kept putting them off with promises, it was clear that he was unhappy. It was not his style to hang onto someone’s pay if he had the money. At this point Epyaxa came to visit Cyrus. She was the wife of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians, and was accompanied by a bodyguard of Cilicians and Aspendians. Rumor was that the queen gave Cyrus a large gift of money. In any case, after she arrived, Cyrus gave the army four months’ pay.</p>
<h3>§8:  At Tyriaeum Cyrus Reviews All the Troops</h3>
<p>From here he marched to Thymbrium, a populous city. Here, by the side of the road, is a spring named after Midas, the king of Phrygia. This was the spring where Midas, as the story goes, caught a satyr by mixing wine with the water.</p>
<p>From Thymbrium he marched to Tyriaeum, a populous city. Here they halted for three days. It is said that Epyaxa begged Cyrus to show her his army. He was only too glad to show off to her, so he held a review of the Greeks and the barbarians in the plain. He ordered the Greeks to draw up their lines and stand in their usual battle order, each general supervising his own men. So they lined up four deep. Menon and his men stood to the right, Clearchus and his men stood to the left, and the remaining generals with their men stood in the center. Cyrus inspected the barbarians first. They marched past him, arranged in troops and divisions. He then inspected the Greeks by driving past them in his chariot with the queen in her carriage. They all had bronze helmets, red tunics, and greaves, and their shields were uncovered.</p>
<h3>§9:  A Mock Charge Panics the Barbarians and Amuses the Greeks</h3>
<p>After he had driven past the whole army, he drew up his chariot in front of the center of the battle-line. Then he sent his interpreter Pigres to the generals of the Greeks, with orders to present arms and for the whole line to advance. This order was repeated by the generals to their men.  At the sound of the bugle, with shields forward and spears ready, they advanced as if to meet an enemy. The pace quickened, and with a shout the soldiers spontaneously fell into a run, heading toward their camp. Great was the panic of the barbarians. The Cilician queen in her carriage turned and fled, the sutlers in the marketing place left what they were selling and took off, and the Greeks meanwhile came into camp with a roar of laughter. The queen was amazed at the brilliancy and order of the army, and Cyrus was pleased to see the terror inspired by the Greeks in the hearts of the barbarians.</p>
<h3>§10:  They March Through Lycaonia and Cappadocia, and Epyaxa Returns to Cilicia</h3>
<p>From this place he marched on three days—twenty parasangs—to Iconium, the last city of Phrygia, where he remained three days. From there he marched through Lycaonia five days—thirty parasangs. This was hostile country, and he gave it over to the Greeks to plunder. At this point Cyrus sent the Cilician queen back to her own country by the quickest route. He sent Menon and his soldiers as her escort. With the rest of the troops he continued his march through Cappadocia four days—twenty-five parasangs—to Dana, a populous city, large and flourishing. During the three days they stayed there, Cyrus put to death a Persian nobleman named Megaphernes, who was charged with conspiracy.  This man was entitled to wear the royal purple. Along with him another high government official was executed.</p>
<h3>§11:  The Pass into Cilicia is Blocked Then Abandoned</h3>
<p>From this place they tried to force their way into Cilicia. Now the road over the pass was extremely steep and narrow, so if an army tried to go up this way and was opposed by a resisting force, it would fail. Syennesis was reported to be on the summit of the pass guarding the approach, so Cyrus and his forces halted a day in the plain.  The next day came a messenger informing them that Syennesis had left the pass. He had learned that Menon’s army was already in Cilicia on his own side of the mountains. He had also heard that ships of war, some belonging to the Lacedaemonians and some to Cyrus himself, with Tamos on board as admiral, were sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia.</p>
<h3>§12:  Cyrus Crosses the Mountains and Descends to Tarsus</h3>
<p>In any case, Cyrus made his way up into the hills unhindered and came in sight of the tents where the Cilicians had been on guard. From that point he descended gradually onto a large and beautiful plain, well watered, and thickly covered with trees of all sorts and vines. This plain produces a large supply of sesame, plus millet and barley and wheat. It is shut in on all sides by a high, steep wall of mountains from sea to sea. Descending through this plain country, he advanced four stages—twenty-five parasangs—to Tarsus. This is a large and prosperous city of Cilicia. Here stood the palace of Syennesis, the king of the country. Through the middle of the city flows a river called the Cydnus, two hundred feet broad.</p>
<h3>§13:  They Find the City Deserted and Plundered</h3>
<p>They found that the city had been deserted by its inhabitants, who had gone with Syennesis to a stronghold on the hills. All had gone, except the shopkeepers. The inhabitants of Soli and Issi also remained. Now Epyaxa, Syennesis's queen, had reached Tarsus five days sooner than Cyrus. As they passed over the mountains into the plain, two companies of Menon's army were lost. Some said they had been cut down by the Cilicians while doing some plundering. Another account was that they had been left behind, were unable to catch up with the others or discover the path, and had gotten lost and died. In any case, they numbered one hundred hoplites. When the rest of Menon’s troops arrived, they were furious at the destruction of their fellow soldiers, and they vented their fury by pillaging the city of Tarsus and the palace to boot.</p>
<h3>§14:  Cyrus and Syennesis Come to Terms and Exchange Gifts</h3>
<p>Now when Cyrus had marched into the city, he sent for Syennesis to come to him. The king replied, though, that he had never yet put himself into the hands of anyone who was his superior and didn’t want to start now. At last his wife persuaded him, and he accepted guarantees of his safety. After this they met, and Syennesis gave Cyrus a large sum of money in aid of his army.  Cyrus in return presented him with the customary royal gifts—a horse with a gold bit, a necklace of gold, a gold bracelet, a gold scimitar, and a Persian robe. He also guaranteed that his territory would be spared from further pillage, and that the slaves that had been seized would be given back if their Cicilian masters came to claim them.</p>
