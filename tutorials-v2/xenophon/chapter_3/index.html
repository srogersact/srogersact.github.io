<h1 class="post-title">Chapter 3:  Clearchus Deals with a Mutiny at Tarsus</h1>

<h2>From <i>The Anabasis</i>, by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>

<h3>§1:  The Troops Mutiny, and Clearchus is Endangered</h3>

<p>At Tarsus Cyrus and his army halted for twenty days, since the soldiers refused to advance further. They suspected that the expedition was really directed against the king, and insisted that they had not been hired for that. Clearchus was the first to try and force his men to continue the march, but they began to throw stones at him and his baggage train whenever he started to move. Clearchus narrowly escaped being stoned to death then and there. Eventually, when he saw that he would not accomplish anything by force, he called an assembly of his men. At first he just stood there for a long time and wept, while the men gazed at him in silent astonishment.</p>
<h3>§2:  Clearchus Begins His Speech: His Friend, Cyrus</h3>
<p>At last he spoke as follows: “Fellow soldiers, don’t be surprised that I am so distressed at how things are going. Cyrus has been no ordinary friend to me. When I was in exile he honored me in various ways, not least of which was by giving me a present of ten thousand darics. These I accepted—not to save them up for myself for private use nor to squander them in pleasure—but to spend them on you. And, first of all, I went to war against the Thracians. With your help, I wreaked vengeance on them for Greece. We drove them out of the Chersonese, when they wanted to deprive its Greek inhabitants of their lands. </p>
<h3>§3:  I Obeyed When He Summoned Me</h3>
<p>“But as soon as Cyrus summoned me, I took you with me and set out. I was eager to pay him back for the good treatment I myself had received from him.</p>
<h3>§4:  If I Have to Choose, I Choose You; The Results of His Speech</h3>
<p>“And now, since you are refusing to continue the march with him, I have only two choices. Either I must abandon you so I can stay friends with Cyrus, or I must be false to him and go with you. Whether I am about to do the right thing or not, I cannot say, but I choose you; and, whatever happens, I will endure it. Nobody will ever say that, when I led Greek troops against the barbarians, I betrayed the Greeks and preferred friendship with the barbarians. No! But since you do not wish to obey me, I will follow after you, and whatever happens, I will endure it. I consider you to be for me my country and my friends and my allies. With you I think I shall be honored, wherever I am; but without you I do not see how I can help a friend or harm an enemy. So count on it that I am going wherever you go.” </p>
Such were his words. But the soldiers, not just his own, but the rest also, when they heard what he had said, that he had refused to go up against the great king, expressed their approval. Then more than two thousand men deserted Xenias and Pasion. They took their weapons and baggage-train and made camp with Clearchus. </p>
<h3>§5:  Cyrus Summons Clearchus, Who Refuses</h3>
<p>Now Cyrus was perplexed and annoyed at what had happened. So he sent for Clearchus, but he refused to come.  Without the knowledge of the soldiers, though, Clearchus sent a messenger to Cyrus. He told him to keep up his courage, for everything would work out the right way. He also asked Cyrus to keep on sending for him, and Clearchus himself kept refusing to go. </p>
<h3>§6:  Clearchus’ Second Speech:  Caution and Clear Thinking Needed</h3>
<p>After that he gathered his own men, those who had joined him, and anybody else who wanted to come.  Then he spoke as follows: “Fellow soldiers, it is obvious that the relations of Cyrus to us are identical with ours to him. We are no longer his soldiers, since we have ceased to follow him; and he, on his side, is no longer our employer. I am sure, though, that he considers himself wronged by us, and even though he keeps sending for me, I refuse to go.  The main reason is that I am ashamed, for I am forced to admit to myself that I have completely let him down. Partly, too, I am afraid he will seize me and punish me for the wrongs that he thinks I have done to him. In my opinion, then, this is the wrong time for us to go to sleep or be careless. Instead now is the time for us to think out our next move. As long as we stay here, though, it seems to me that we had better figure out how we are to make our stay as safe as possible. Or, if we decide to leave at once, we need to figure out what will be the safest way to retreat—as well as how we are to get supplies, for without supplies neither a general nor a private is worth anything. </p>
<h3>§7:  Cyrus Is a Very Dangerous Enemy</h3>
<p>“The man we’re dealing with is excellent as a friend, but very dangerous as a foe. And he is backed by a force of infantry and cavalry and ships that we all see very well and know, since we can hardly be said to be very far from him. So, then, now is the time for anyone to speak up and say what they think is best.” With these words he ceased.</p>
<h3>§8:  Other Speakers Make Suggestions</h3>
<p>Then various speakers stood up. Some of them got up on their own to say what they thought.  But there were others, too, who were put up to it by Clearchus. These men pointed out the impossibility of either staying or going back without Cyrus’s approval. One of these, in particular, pretended to be anxious to get back to Greece as quickly as possible.  He urged them to choose other generals immediately if Clearchus would not lead them back, to purchase supplies (the market being in the heart of the barbarian camp!), and to pack up. Then they were to go to Cyrus and ask for some ships so they could sail away. If, however, he refused, they were to ask for a guide who could lead them back through friendly territory. If he would not even give them a guide, the speaker said, they could quickly put themselves in marching order and send troops to occupy the pass—“before we are beaten to it by Cyrus and the Cilicians, whose slaves and property we have so plentifully pillaged.” </p>
<h3>§9:  Clearchus Refuses to Take Command</h3>
<p>When that speaker had finished, he was followed by Clearchus, who merely said: “Let none of you suggest that I might be the commander for such an enterprise—for I can see numerous obstacles to my doing so—but whoever you do elect I will obey completely. And you will see that I can take orders, too, as well as anybody.”</p>
<h3>§10:  Another Speaker Shows the Safety Measures are Nonsensical</h3>
<p>After Clearchus another speaker stood up. He pointed out what nonsense the man had talked who had said they should ask for ships, just as if Cyrus had decided to give up and head home. “And let me also point out,” he said, “what nonsense it is to ask for a guide from the very man whose plans we are ruining. If we can trust the guide that Cyrus provides, why not just order Cyrus to occupy the pass for us? I, at least, would hesitate to set foot on any ships that he might give us, for fear that he might sink them with his triremes. I would also be afraid to follow any guide he gives us, for he might lead us into some place from which escape would be impossible. If I am going to leave without Cyrus’s permission, I had better leave without his knowledge—which isn’t going to happen!</p>
<h3>§11:  He Proposes That a Group Talk to Cyrus</h3>
<p>“No, I say, this is complete nonsense! Instead, I think some men should go to Cyrus with Clearchus to ask him how he is planning to employ us. If the job is like the earlier one for which he used mercenaries, we will go, too, and be as brave as they were. But if it looks like a bigger job than the earlier one—involving more work and more danger—we’ll ask him either to persuade us to follow him or to be persuaded himself to send us away into a friendly country. Thus if we follow him, we will follow as friends and with a good attitude; or if we go back, we will go safely. Whatever he says shall be reported to us here, and when we have heard it, we will decide what to do.”</p>
<h3>§12:  The Group is Sent, and Cyrus Explains His Plan and Promises Extra Pay</h3>
<p>They agreed to this and chose some people to send with Clearchus. When the men got there, they asked Cyrus the things the army had agreed on. Cyrus replied that he had heard that an enemy of his named Abrocomas was on the Euphrates, twelve days’ march away, so he wanted to march against him. If he was still there when they arrived, he said, he would punish him as he deserved, “or if he has escaped we will make new plans.” The men received the answer and reported it to the soldiers. They suspected that he was leading them against the king, but they decided to follow him anyway. They asked for a raise, and Cyrus promised to give everyone half again as much as they had been making—so each soldier would make three half-darics a month instead of a daric. And not even at this point did anyone hear that he was leading them against the king, at least not publicly. </p>
