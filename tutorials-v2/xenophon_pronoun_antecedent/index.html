<h3>§1:  A Dying King Sends for <span class="tooltip">His <span class="tooltiptext">the dying king's</span></span> Sons</h3>

<p class = "big">Darius the king of Persia and the queen, Parysatis, had two sons: Artaxerxes and <span class="tooltip">his younger brother<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes' younger brother</span></span>, Cyrus. When Darius was sick and suspected that <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Darius</span></span> was about to die, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Darius</span></span> wanted both of <span class="tooltip">his sons<span class="tooltiptext">Darius' sons</span></span> to be with <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Darius</span></span>. Artaxerxes happened to be at the palace already, but <span class="tooltip">his younger brother<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes' younger brother</span></span> was far away and had to be sent for.  Cyrus was the satrap (governor) of a satrapy (province) that <span class="tooltip">his father<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus' father</span></span> had given <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>. <span class="tooltip">His father<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's father</span></span>  had also made <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> general of the armies that are gathered in the plain of Castolus. When Cyrus received the message, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> traveled to where <span class="tooltip">his father<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's father</span></span> was. <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> took along Tissaphernes, <span class="tooltip">whom he thought was<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus thought that Tissaphernes was…</span></span> <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> friend. <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> also took along three hundred heavily armed Greek soldiers, or “hoplites,” and <span class="tooltip">their commander<span class="tooltiptext">the commander of the three hundred heavily armed Greek soldiers</span></span>, Xenias the Parrhasian.</p>

<h3>§2:  Cyrus Is Arrested and Released</h3>
<p class = "big">Darius died and Artaxerxes became king. Then Tissaphernes told Artaxerxes that <span class="tooltip">his brother<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes' brother</span></span> was plotting against <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes</span></span>. When Artaxerxes heard Tissaphernes’ accusation, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes</span></span> had Cyrus arrested and was about to have <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> executed.  <span class="tooltip">Their mother<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxe's and Cyrus's mother</span></span>, though, begged for <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> life and sent <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> back safely to <span class="tooltip">his province<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's province</span></span>. </p>

<h3>§3:  Cyrus Plots Against His Brother and Wins Persian Support</h3>
<p class = "big"><span class="tooltip">This<span class="tooltiptext">Being arrested and nearly executed by Artaxerxes then rescued by Mom</span></span> was not only a narrow escape for <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>, but also a dishonor. So <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> decided <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> would do <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus'</span></span> best never to be in <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus'</span></span> brother’s power again and began to plan how <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> could become king instead.  Right from the first, <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> mother, Parysatis, was on <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> side because <span class="tooltip">she<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's mother, Parysatis</span></span> loved Cyrus more than Artaxerxes. Cyrus also won over the people from the king’s court whenever <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the people from the king’s court</span></span> visited <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>.  Additionally, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> trained the barbarian soldiers under <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> command so that <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the barbarian soldiers under Cyrus's command</span></span> would be skillful warriors and loyal to <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>. Lastly, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> began to gather a Greek army—secretly, though, so that <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> could take the king by surprise.</p>

<h3>§4:  <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> Recruits a Greek Army and Besieges Miletus</h3>
<p>This is how <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> went about <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">gathering a Greek army secretly</span></span>. There were some cities in Ionia that the king had given to Tissaphernes. <span class="tooltip">These cities<span class="tooltiptext">the cities in Ionia that the king had given to Tissaphernes</span></span> rebelled against <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Tissaphernes</span></span> and made Cyrus <span class="tooltip">their governor<span class="tooltiptext">governor of the cities in Ionia that the king had given to Tissaphernes</span></span> instead.  So Cyrus gave orders for the commander of the troops in each city to hire the best Peloponnesian mercenaries <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the commanders of the troops in each city</span></span> could find. <span class="tooltip">His<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> excuse was that Tissaphernes was plotting against the cities. Another Ionian city, Miletus, also tried to rebel against Tissaphernes.  <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Tissaphernes</span></span> found out about <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">Miletus trying to rebel against Tissaphernes</span></span>, though, and executed some of the people who had plotted against <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Tissaphernes</span></span> and sent <span class="tooltip">the rest<span class="tooltiptext">the rest of the people who had plotted against Tissaphernes</span></span> into exile. So <span class="tooltip">here<span class="tooltiptext">the problem of the people Tissaphernes had exiled from Miletus</span></span> was another excuse Cyrus could use to raise an army, because <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> gathered the people in exile from Miletus and formed an army out of <span class="tooltip">them<span class="tooltiptext">the people in exile from Miletus</span></span>. Then <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the people in exile from Miletus</span></span> besieged Miletus by land and sea to try to get back into <span class="tooltip">their city<span class="tooltiptext">the city of the people in exile from Miletus—which, of course, is Miletus</span></span>.</p>

<h3>§5:  <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> Fools the King</h3>
<p>While <span class="tooltip">this<span class="tooltiptext">recruiting a Greek army by besieging Miletus</span></span> was going on, Cyrus sent a message to Artaxerxes and requested that <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>, as the king's brother, be made governor of the Ionian cities instead of Tissaphernes. The queen helped Cyrus fool <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus's</span></span> brother, so that the king could not tell that <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes'</span></span> younger brother was plotting against <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes</span></span>. Artaxerxes thought Cyrus was buying weapons and hiring soldiers so <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> could make war on Tissaphernes. Nor did it bother <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes</span></span> too much to see <span class="tooltip">those two<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus and Tissaphernes</span></span> at war with each other, especially since Cyrus made sure the king got the payments due to <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">the king (Artaxerxes)</span></span> from the cities that had belonged to Tissaphernes.</p>

<h3>§6:  Clearchus Recruits a Third Army on the Chersonese</h3>
<p>A third army was recruited for <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> on the Chersonese, across from Abydos, in the following way.  Clearchus was an exile from Sparta. Cyrus became friends with <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span> and admired <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span>. <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> gave Clearchus a huge amount of gold—ten thousand darics—as a gift. Clearchus used that money to raise an army to defend the Greeks against the Thracians to <span class="tooltip">their<span class="tooltiptext">the Greeks'</span></span> north. The cities on the Chersonese that <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span> defended were so thankful that <span class="tooltip">they<span class="tooltiptext">the cities on the Chersonese that Clearchus defended </span></span> contributed even more money to support the troops. So <span class="tooltip">this<span class="tooltiptext">giving money to Clearchus to raise an army to defend the Greeks against the Thracians</span></span> was another way in which Cyrus kept an army ready for use.</p>

<h3>§7:  Aristippus Recruits a Fourth Army and Gets More Than <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus</span></span> Asked For</h3>
<p>Cyrus had another friend named Aristippus. <span class="tooltip">This man<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus</span></span> had some enemies at home in Thessaly who were making things difficult for <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus</span></span>. So Aristippus came to Cyrus and asked <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> for enough money to hire two thousand mercenaries for three months. <span class="tooltip">That way<span class="tooltiptext">By hiring two thousand mercenaries for three months</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus</span></span> said, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus</span></span> could get the best of <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus's</span></span> rivals.  <span class="tooltip">Instead<span class="tooltiptext">Instead of giving Aristippus enough money to hire two thousand mercenaries for three months</span></span>, Cyrus gave <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus</span></span> six months’ pay for four thousand mercenaries. The only condition was that Aristippus had to agree not to make up with <span class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus's</span></span> enemies before talking to Cyrus about <span class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">making up with the enemies</span></span>. So <span class="tooltip">this<span class="tooltiptext">Aristippus's army</span></span> was a fourth secret army.</p>

<h3>§8:  Other Greek Generals Gather Armies</h3>
<p><span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> had other friends recruit armies for <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>, too. To <span class="tooltip">one<span class="tooltiptext">one friend</span></span> <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> said that <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> wanted help fighting the Pisidians. <span class="tooltip">He<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> told two <span class="tooltip">others<span class="tooltiptext">other friends</span></span> that <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> would like <span class="tooltip">them<span class="tooltiptext">the two other friends</span></span> to gather an army to help <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> fight Tissaphernes with the Milesian exiles.</p>
