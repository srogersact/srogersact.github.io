<h1 class="post-title">Chapter 4: Generals Desert Cyrus or Show Off to Him</h1>

<h2>From <i>The Anabasis</i>, by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>

<h3>§1:  <!-- At Issi Cyrus’s Fleet Arrives --> </h3>

<p>From here he marched two days—ten parasangs—to the Psarus River, which is two hundred feet wide. From the Psarus he marched a single stage—five parasangs—to Issi, the last city in Cilicia. It is a large, prosperous city on the coast. They halted here for three days, and thirty-five ships from the Peloponnesus joined Cyrus. Their admiral was Pythagoras the Lacedaemonian. Tamos the Egyptian had led the way from Ephesus.  He commanded twenty-five other ships belonging to Cyrus with which he had blockaded Miletus. Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian was also on board the fleet. He had been sent for by Cyrus and brought with him seven hundred hoplites, over whom he was to act as general in the service of Cyrus. The ships anchored opposite Cyrus’s tent. Four hundred Greek hoplites also arrived.  These had served Abrocomas as mercenaries, but they deserted him for Cyrus and joined the campaign against the king. </p>

<h3>§2:  <!-- The Syrian Gate is Unguarded --> </h3>
<p>From here he marched a single stage of five parasangs to the gates of Cilicia and Syria. These gates were in two walls: the inner gate, on the Cilician side, was held by Syennesis and a garrison of Cilicians; the outer one, towards Syria, was reported to have been guarded by the king's troops. The walls are six hundred yards apart, and a river named the Carsus—itself 100 feet across—flows down through the gap between them. Although there are gates built into the walls on either side, it is impossible to get past them by force: the road through is narrow, while the walls themselves reach down to the sea at one end and to steep rocks at the other. Cyrus had sent for the ships because of this entry. He expected to find Abrocomas and a large army guarding the Syrian gate, so Cyrus had planned to put hoplites both inside and outside the gates and thus overpower the enemy forces. This, however, Abrocomas had not done. Instead, when he had heard that Cyrus was in Cilicia, he had left Phoenicia to march to the king with, it was reported, an army of three hundred thousand men. </p>


<h3>§3: <!-- Xenias and Pasion Go Missing --></h3>
<p>Cyrus continued through Syria one day’s march—five parasangs—to Myriandus, a Phoenician city on the sea. This was a commercial port, and many merchant ships lay at anchor in the harbor. During the seven days the army halted here, Xenias the Arcadian and Pasion the Megarian got on board a ship, stowed their most valuable possessions, and sailed away. Most people thought these two generals were jealous because, when their men deserted to Clearchus so they could go back to Greece and not march against the king, Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to keep them under his command. When the two had disappeared, word went around that Cyrus would chase them with triremes; and while some prayed for the cowards to be caught, others pitied them if they were. </p>

<h3>§4: <!-- The Response of Cyrus to the Desertion of Xenias and Pasion --></h3>
<p>But Cyrus summoned the generals and said, "Xenias and Pasion have left us. Well, I hope they realize that they have not succeeded in sneaking off, for I know where they have gone; nor have they escaped me, for I have triremes to capture their ship. But, no, by the gods, I will not chase them. Nor will anyone say of me that I use people when they stay with me, but when they want to leave I round them up and not only mistreat them but strip them of their wealth. No, let them go—with the knowledge that they are treating us worse than we are treating them. Even though I do have their children and wives under my protection in Tralles, they shall not be deprived even of these. They shall get them back because of the good work they did for me in the past.” Thus he spoke, and the Greeks, even those who had been unhappiest about the march inland, when they heard of the goodness of Cyrus, were happier and more eager to go along. </p>

<h3>§5: <!-- Fish Gods and Spending Money --></h3>
<p>After this Cyrus marched onwards four days—twenty parasangs—to the river Chalus, which is a hundred feet wide. The river is full of large, tame fish that the Syrians regard as gods. They will not allow anyone to injure them—nor the pigeons. They camped in villages that had been given to Parysatis as a source of spending money. </p>

<h3>§6: <!-- A Palace and a Park Are Ruined --></h3>
<p>From this point he marched on five days—thirty parasangs—to the sources of the river Dardas, which is a hundred feet wide. Here stood the palace of Belesys, the ruler of Syria, and a very large and beautiful park that produced food in all seasons.  Cyrus chopped it down, though, and burned down the palace. </p>

<h3>§7: <!-- The Soldiers Demand More Money for Marching Against the King --></h3>
<p>From there he marched on three days—fifteen parasangs—to the river Euphrates, which is half a mile wide. Here there is a large and prosperous city named Thapsacus. He stayed here five days. Cyrus sent for the Greek generals and not only told them that he was marching into Babylon, against the great king, but also ordered them to tell these things to the soldiers and persuade them to follow. The generals called a meeting and announced the news. The soldiers were angry with the generals, whom they accused of having known all along and kept it a secret. They refused to go unless someone gave them the same amount of money as was given to the soldiers who had gone with Cyrus previously.  And that money, they also pointed out, was not for men going to war but going when Cyrus’ father had called for him. The generals reported this back to Cyrus, and he promised to give each man five silver minas when they arrived at Babylon, and their full pay until he had brought them back to Ionia again. </p>

<p class="summary">
After three more days, they came to the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Euphrates</span></span> River, which is <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">half a mile </span></span>wide. Cyrus told the Greek generals to inform their <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">soldiers</span></span>that he was marching to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Babylon</span></span>to fight against <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the great king</span></span>. He also wanted them to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">persuade</span></span>them to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">follow</span></span>. When they heard, the soldiers were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">angry</span></span>, thinking the generals had <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">known</span></span>about it and had kept it a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">secret</span></span>from them. The soldiers demanded more <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">money</span></span>. Cyrus promised that, once they got to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Babylon</span></span>, he would give each soldier <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">five</span></span>silver <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">minas</span></span>, which we can guess must be a kind of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">coin</span></span>. He also promised them their full pay until they got back to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Ionia</span></span>.</p>

<h3>§8: <!-- Menon Persuades His Men to Be First --></h3>
<p>Most of the Greek force were persuaded by this. Menon, though, before it was clear whether the other soldiers would would follow Cyrus or not, called together his own troops apart from the others and made the following speech: "Men," he said, "if you will follow my advice, you will—without danger or extra work—win more favor with Cyrus than the other soldiers. So what am I urging you to do? Right now Cyrus is begging the Greeks to follow him against the king. So I say you need to cross the Euphrates before it is clear how the other Greeks will answer Cyrus. For if they vote in favor of following, you will seem to have been the cause by crossing first. Cyrus will be grateful to you for being the most eager and will reward you—and he knows how to better than anybody. On the other hand, if the rest vote against crossing, we Greeks will all go back again.  But, because you were faithful, he will treat you as the most trustworthy for garrison duty and positions of leadership. And I know that you, as his friends, will get whatever else you want from Cyrus." </p>

<p class="summary">
Then Menon got his own <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">troops</span></span>together and made a speech about <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">crossing</span></span>the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Euphrates River</span></span>before the other Greeks had a chance to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">vote</span></span>. That way, if the other Greeks <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">voted</span></span>to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">cross the river</span></span>, Menon’s men would seem to have been the leaders. But if the other Greeks <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">voted</span></span>not to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">cross the river</span></span>, Menon’s men would <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">go back again (meaning, go home)</span></span>with them. Either way, Cyrus would be <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">grateful to them</span></span>and would <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">reward</span></span>Menon’s men with <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">garrison</span></span>duty and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">positions</span></span>of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">leadership</span></span>. </p>

<h3>§9: <!-- Menon and His Troops Are Rewarded, and Cyrus Is Honored by the River --></h3>
<p>They were convinced by this and forded the river before the others had given their answer. When Cyrus found out that Menon's troops had crossed, he was pleased and sent Glus to them with this message: "Soldiers, I am delighted with you now, but I will see to it that you are also delighted with me, or my name is not Cyrus." The soldiers had high hopes and prayed for his success. But to Menon, it was said, he sent gifts like a prince. This done, Cyrus forded the river, and all the rest of the army followed him. As they forded the river, nobody got wet above the chest, although the people of Thapascus were saying that the river had never been crossed on foot until then but only in boats. They said that Abrocomas had gone ahead of them and burned the boats to keep Cyrus from crossing. It did indeed seem a miracle, as if the river had surely made way for Cyrus as for a king. </p>

The river, it seemed to the people of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Thapascus</span></span>, treated Cyrus like a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">king</span></span>because it allowed his army to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">cross</span></span>on <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">foot</span></span>without the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">boats</span></span>that <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Abrocomas</span></span>had burned. </p>

<h3>§10: <!-- Cyrus Reaches the River Araxes --></h3>
<p>From here he marched through Syria nine days—fifty parasangs—and arrived at the river Araxes. Here were many villages full of food and wine.  They halted here three days and stocked up on provisions. </p>
