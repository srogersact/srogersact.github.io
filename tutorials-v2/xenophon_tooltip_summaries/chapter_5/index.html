<h1 class="post-title">Chapter 5:  Crossing a Desert, Tempers Flare</h1>

<h2>From <i>The Anabasis</i>, by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>


<p>§1.  From here he marched on for five days through Arabia with the Euphrates River on the right—thirty-five parasangs through the desert. In this region the ground was a plain, level like the sea.  It was full of wormwood, and all the other shrubs or reeds there were fragrant like spices or sweet herbs. There were no trees, but there were all kinds of wild game—an abundance of wild donkeys and plenty of ostriches, as well as bustards (crane-like birds) and antelopes. These creatures the cavalry sometimes chased. The donkeys, when chased, would run forward a ways and stand still, for they ran much faster than the horses. As soon as the horses got close again, they did the same thing. They could not be caught unless the riders spread out and hunted them in relays. The flesh of the ones they caught was like venison, only more tender. Nobody caught an ostrich. Those who tried it gave up quickly; for the bird sped far off, running with its legs and using its wings like a sail. The bustards could be caught if flushed suddenly; for they take short flights, like partridges, and tire quickly. Their flesh was delicious.</p>

They tried to catch <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">ostriches</span></span>, too, but they ran too fast and used their wings like <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">sails</span></span>. They were more successful catching bustards, which are like <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">cranes</span></span>. They caught the animals because they wanted to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">eat them</span></span>. 
</p>


<p>§2.  Marching through this region, they arrived at the river Mascas, which is one hundred feet wide. Here there was a large deserted city called Corsote.  It is encircled by the Mascas, which flows around it. They remained here three days and got provisions. Then they marched thirteen days through the desert—ninety parasangs—keeping the Euphrates on their right, until they reached a place called “the Gates.” On these marches many of the pack animals died of hunger, for there was neither grass nor tree of any kind—the whole country was bare. The people who live there quarry stones from the riverbanks and make them into millstones that they take to Babylon. They sell them there and buy food in exchange. The army ran out of food and could not buy any except in the Lydian market that traveled with Cyrus's barbarian army—at a price of four shekels for a kapithe of wheat or barley!  (A shekel is equal to seven and a half Attic obols, and a kapithe is equal to two Attic choeneces.) So the soldiers got by eating meat. Some of the marches were very long, whenever they had to get to water or find grass for the animals.</p>

<p class="summary">
	The army somehow got provisions in <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Corsote</span></span>, on the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Mascas</span></span>  River, even though this large city was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">deserted. </span></span>  They needed provisions because they were about to march for <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">thirteen</span></span> days through a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">desert</span></span>.

</p>


<p>§3.  Once there was a narrow, muddy place that was hard for the wagons to get through. Cyrus halted and ordered Glus and Pigres to take some of the barbarian army and help in getting the wagons out. When he thought they were too slow, he angrily ordered the Persian nobles that were around him to help get the wagons out. Then, if ever, a sample of good discipline was to be witnessed. Each of the noblemen threw off his purple cloak wherever he happened to be standing, and flung himself into the work as if running for down a steep hill toward victory. Still in their expensive tunics and embroidered pants—and some even wearing necklaces around their necks and bracelets on their wrists—they had leapt down into the mud in an instant, and in less time than one could have thought possible, they had lifted out the wagons. </p>

</p>


<p>§4.  It was obvious that Cyrus was in a hurry all along the way and not wasting any time except where he had to stop for supplies or something else that was important. He thought that the faster he went, the less prepared the king would be for battle; but the slower he went, the larger the army the king could gather. Indeed, anybody who paid attention could see that the king's empire could be considered strong because of its large size and population, but if an invader made war by forced marches the empire was weak in that its roads are long and its military forces are spread so far apart.</p>

<p class="summary">
	Cyrus was obviously <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">in a hurry</span></span>. He wanted to go as <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">fast</span></span> as possibly so the king would be as <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">unprepared</span></span> as possible. On the other hand, the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">slower</span></span> Cyrus went the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">larger</span></span> the king’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">army</span></span> would be.

</p>


<p>§5.  On the opposite bank of the Euphrates as they marched through the desert, there was a large and prosperous city named Charmande. From this town the soldiers bought supplies by crossing the river on rafts. They made the rafts by taking the skins they used for tent coverings and filling them with grass. Then they pulled them together and sewed them up so the water would not touch the hay. On these they crossed and got what they needed: wine made from date wine of the date-palm, and millet bread, which is plentiful in that country. </p>

<p class="summary">
	Soldiers made <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">rafts</span></span> to cross the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Euphrates</span></span> River out of the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">skins</span></span> that covered their <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">tents</span></span>.

</p>


<p>§6.  Here there was an argument between the soldiers of Menon and Clearchus. Clearchus decided that one of Menon's men was at fault and had him flogged. The man went back to his own troops and told them. When they heard what had happened, his comrades were furious with Clearchus. That same day Clearchus went to the place where they crossed the river and inspected the market there. He was returning on horseback to his tent and had to pass through Menon's troops with just a few of his own men along. Cyrus had not arrived yet, but was still on his way. One of Menon's men was splitting wood, saw Clearchus as he rode past, and hurled his axe at him. This man missed, but another threw a rock, and another did, then many with a roar.</p>

This was where there was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">an argument</span></span> between <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Menon</span></span>’s soldiers and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span>’s soldiers. Clearchus ordered that one of Menon’s men be <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">flogged</span></span>. When some of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Menon</span></span>’s other soldiers heard about it they were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">furious</span></span> with Clearchus.

</p>


<p>§7.  Clearchus fled to his own troops and immediately called them to arms. He ordered his hoplites to stay in position with their shields resting against their knees. Meanwhile, he took his Thracians and his horsemen—he had over forty horsemen in his army, mostly Thracians themselves—and advanced against Menon's soldiers. The soldiers and even  Menon himself were panic-stricken. Most ran for their weapons, but some just stood there, perplexed at what was happening. Just then Proxenus happened to be coming up from behind, leading his division of hoplites. Immediately he marched his troops into position between the two sides and was begging Clearchus to stop. Having barely escaped being stoned to death, Clearchus was angry that Proxenus talked as if it were no big deal, and he told Proxenus to get out of the way. </p>

<p class="summary">
	Clearchus rode quickly back to his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">troops</span></span> and called them <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">to arms</span></span>. He left his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">hoplites</span></span> behind ready to do battle, but he took his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Thracians</span></span> and his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">horsemen</span></span> and advanced against <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Menon</span></span>’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">soldiers</span></span>, who were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">panic-stricken</span></span> and either ran for their <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">weapons</span></span> or just <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">stood there</span></span>, perplexed. <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Proxenus</span></span>, who was coming up from behind with a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">division</span></span> of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">hoplites</span></span>, marched his troops in between the two sides and begged <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span>  to stop.

</p>


<p>§8. At this moment Cyrus arrived and asked what was the matter. Instantly taking his javelins in his hands and riding up into the middle with some of his faithful bodyguard, he said the following: "Clearchus and Proxenus and you other Greeks here, you don’t know what you’re doing. If you get into some battle with each other, realize that in this very day I shall be cut to bits—and you not long after! If we have trouble getting along, all these barbarians you see around you will be more hostile to us than those who are on the king’s side." Hearing these words, Clearchus got control of himself. Both sides quit what they were doing and put away their weapons.</p>
