<h1 class="post-title">Chapter 6:  A Dangerous Friend</h1>

<h2>From <i>The Anabasis</i>, by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>


<p>§1.  As they went on from there, the hoof-prints and droppings of horses kept showing up. It was guessed to be the trail of about two thousand horses. The riders had gone ahead of Cyrus's army, burning the grass and anything else that was useful. </p>
<p>§2.  There was a Persian named Orontas, whose family was closely related to the king, and who was said to be one of the best Persians at military science. Though he had once been at war with Cyrus and had made peace, he was plotting against Cyrus. He said to Cyrus that, if he would assign to him a thousand horsemen, he would ambush the horsemen who were doing the burning. Then he would either destroy them or take many of them alive and stop them from burning the ground in front of them. He would make sure that these people who had seen Cyrus's army could not report it to the king. Cyrus thought it was a good idea and ordered Orontas to take a detachment of horses from each of his commanders. </p>

It looked as if there were about <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">2000</span></span>  horsemen riding ahead of the army, burning up the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">grass</span></span>  and anything else of use. There was an important <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Persian</span></span>  named <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Orontas</span></span>. He and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>  had been <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">enemies</span></span>  but were now supposedly <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">friends</span></span>. He asked Cyrus for <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">1000</span></span>  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">horsemen</span></span>  so he could go and stop the riders who were burning the land in front of Cyrus’s army. He would also make sure they did not tell <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the king</span></span>  about <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">army</span></span>. Cyrus said yes to the plan. Orontas was probably happy because this would allow him to (choose one) <span class="tooltip"><b>help / hurt</b><span class="tooltiptext">hurt</span></span>  Cyrus. </p>

<p>§3.  When Orontas was convinced that he would have the horses he asked for, he wrote a letter to the king. In his letter he said that he would join him with as many cavalry as he could and asked him to instruct the royal cavalry to welcome him as a friend. The letter also contained reminders of their former friendship and loyalty. This letter he gave to a reliable messenger—or so he thought. Instead the “reliable messenger” gave it to Cyrus. </p>
<p>§4.  Upon reading it, Cyrus arrested Orontas. Then he summoned to his tent the seven noblest Persians from among his personal attendants. He ordered the Greek generals to bring hoplites and station them around his tent. The generals did this, bringing about three thousand hoplites. Clearchus was even invited inside to take part in the court-martial, since he seemed to Cyrus and the others to be the most distinguished of the Greeks. When Clearchus came out, he reported to his friends what had happened at the trial, since it was no secret. </p>

<p class="summary">
Orontas wrote a letter to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the king</span></span>. Orontas said he was coming to the king with <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">cavalry</span></span>  (which are <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">horsemen</span></span>), and he reminded the king of their <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">friendship</span></span>. He gave the letter to a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">messenger</span></span> who, he thought, would deliver it to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the king</span></span>. Instead, the messenger took the letter to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>. Cyrus <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">arrested</span></span>  Orontas. He gathered <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">seven</span></span>  important <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Persians</span></span>. He ordered the Greek generals to bring <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">hoplites</span></span>  to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">guard</span></span>  his tent. He let <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span>  join them inside the tent. Clearchus told his friends about <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the trial</span></span>. </p>


<p>§5.  Clearchus said that Cyrus began the inquiry with these words: “I have invited you here, friends, so that I can decide with you and carry out whatever punishment is right in the sight of God and man concerning this Orontas fellow. In the first place, my own father decreed that this man would be my subject. Then, ordered by my brother—as he himself admits—this man held the acropolis of Sardis and made war against me. I answered war with war. That made him think war with me was not such a good idea. So we shook hands on it. </p>
<p>§6.  “After that,” Cyrus said, “Orontas, is there any way in which I wronged you?" </p>
<p>
He replied, “No.” </p>
<p>
Again Cyrus asked, “Then later on, although, as you admit, I did nothing wrong to you, did you not join sides with the Mysians and injure my territory as much as you could?” </p>
<p>
Orontas agreed that he had. </p>
<p>
“Then, when you had again seen how weak you were, did you not come to the altar of Artemis saying that you were sorry for what you had done? And did you not persuade me so that we again exchanged pledges of friendship?” </p>
<p>
These things, also, Orontas confessed. </p>
<p>
“So then what wrong have I done to you,” Cyrus asked, “that now for the third time, you were clearly plotting against me?” </p>
<p>
“You have done me no wrong,” Orontas replied. </p>
<p>
And Cyrus asked, “Then you admit that you have done me wrong?” </p>
<p>
“Indeed I must,” he answered. </p>
<p>
Then Cyrus asked one more question:  “Then can you ever be an enemy to my brother and a loyal friend to me?” </p>
<p>
He answered: “Even if I were, Cyrus, you would never believe it.” </p>

<p class="summary">
Cyrus told his friends that he had invited them to help decide on a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">punishment</span></span>  for Orontas that was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">right</span></span>  in the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">sight</span></span>  of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">God</span></span>  and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">man</span></span>. Cyrus said that <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">his father</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the king</span></span>, had said that Orontas was to be his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">subject</span></span>, but Orontas worked instead for Cyrus’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">brother</span></span>  (<span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes</span></span>) and fought against Cyrus at <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Sardis</span></span>. Then they shook hands and were friends. After that, even though <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>  did nothing wrong to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Orontas</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Orontas</span></span>  joined the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Mysians</span></span>  in harming <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">territory</span></span>. Then Orontas went to the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">altar</span></span>  of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Artemis</span></span>, said he was sorry, and made up with Cyrus. Now, for the third time, Orontas was plotting to hurt Cyrus, and Orontas agreed that <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span>  had done nothing wrong to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Orontas</span></span>. Now Orontas doubted that Cyrus would ever <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">trust</span></span>  him again. </p>


<p>§7.  So Cyrus said to those present: “That is what he did, and that is what he has to say. Clearchus, you first, give your opinion as you see fit.” </p>
<p>And Clearchus answered, “I recommend that you get rid of this man as fast as you can. That way we won’t have to worry about him and will have more of a chance to reward our real friends.” Clearchus said that the others agreed with him. </p>

<p class="summary">
Cyrus asked <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span>  for his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">opinion</span></span>  first, which was to get rid of Orontas ASAP, and the Persian nobles <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">agreed</span></span>  with him. </p>

<p>§8. After that, he said, Cyrus gave the order, and they all stood up—even the relatives of Orontas—and marked him for the death sentence by taking hold of him by the belt.  Then those who had been given the job led him out. And when anyone saw him who used to bow to him, they also bowed to him now, even though they knew he was being led to his death. </p>
<p>§9.Then he was taken into the tent of Artapates, the most faithful of Cyrus's scepter-bearers, and no one ever saw Orontas again, alive or dead. Nor did anyone who actually saw it tell how Orontas died, though some guessed one thing and some another. No tomb for him was ever seen. </p>

<p class="summary">

You could tell that Orontas had been condemned to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">death</span></span>  because all the Persians stood up and took hold of him by the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">belt</span></span>. You could tell that Orontas must have been (choose) <span class="tooltip"><b>an important / a bad </b><span class="tooltiptext">an important </span></span> man because even as he was led away, Orontas was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">bowed to</span></span> by those who were used to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">bowing to</span></span> him. Orontas was never <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">seen</span></span> again after being taken to the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">tent</span></span> of Artapates. </p>
