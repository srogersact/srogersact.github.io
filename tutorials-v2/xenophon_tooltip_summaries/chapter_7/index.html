<h2>From <i>The Anabasis</i>, by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>


<p><b>§1</b> From this place Cyrus marched twelve parasangs through Babylonia in three days. On the third day, Cyrus held a review of the Greeks and barbarians in the plain at about midnight, because he thought that, at dawn the following day, the king would arrive with his army to do battle. Cyrus ordered Clearchus to command the right wing and Menon the left, while he drew up his own forces himself. After the review, when it was nearly day, deserters from the great king arrived and informed Cyrus about the royal army. Then Cyrus called together the generals and captains of the Greeks and consulted with them about how he would do battle.  </p>


<p class="summary">

Cyrus marched through <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Babylonia</span></span>. One night at <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">midnight</span></span>he reviewed the troops because he thought <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the king</span></span> would arrive at <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">dawn</span></span>. Some men who had <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">deserted</span></span> the king arrived and told <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Cyrus</span></span> about <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">the king</span></span>’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">army</span></span>. Cyrus met with the Greek <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">generals</span></span> and  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">captains</span></span> to plan. </p>


<p><b>§2</b> He also encouraged them in the following manner: “Men of Greece, it is not from any lack of barbarians that I am leading you as my allies. No, I brought you along because I consider you better and stronger than many barbarians. </p>

<p>“Now then, I want you to be worthy of the freedom you possess and for which I congratulate you—I would choose freedom instead of all I own and much more besides. I also want you to know what sort of contest you are going into, so I will inform you from my own experience. There are many of them, and they will come on with a shout. But, if you can endure these two things, after that I really am embarrassed at what you will find the people of this land to be like. But if you are men, and if things turn out well for me, here is what I will do. If anyone decides to go home, I will make him the envy of those at home. However, I think I will make many of you choose what I have to offer instead of what you had at home.” </p>

<p class="summary">
Cyrus said that he thought the Greeks were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">better</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">stronger</span></span> than many barbarians. He said that he was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">embarrassed</span></span> by the people of Persia. He promised that, if things turned out well for him, he would make the Greeks who returned home the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">envy</span></span> of those at home. But he thought he would persuade most Greeks to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">stay</span></span> with him. </p>

<p><b>§3</b> Then a trusted friend of Cyrus named Gaulites, an exile from Samos, said, “And yet, Cyrus, some people say you are promising a lot now when danger is approaching; but if it turns out all right, they say, you’ll forget. And some say that, even if you did remember and wanted to, you could not reward as you promise.” </p>
<p>When Cyrus heard that, he answered: “Well, in point of fact, men, my father's empire stretches south to where men cannot live because of the heat, and northwards to where men cannot live because of the cold.  Everything in between is ruled by satraps who are my brother's friends. If we are victorious, we will have to make our own friends the masters. So my fear is not whether I will have enough to reward each of my friends if things go well, but whether I will have enough friends to reward. And I will give to each of you Greeks a gold crown." </p>

<p class="summary">

Cyrus had a friend named Gaulites who was an <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">exile</span></span> from <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Samos</span></span>.  This man questioned him saying that some people said Cyrus promised a lot now when they were in <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">danger</span></span> but would <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">forget</span></span> if things turned out well for him. Cyrus said that his father’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">empire</span></span> was so huge that he was more concerned about having enough <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">friends</span></span> to reward by making them the new <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">masters</span></span> than about having enough to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">reward</span></span>his friends. He said he would give each Greek a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">gold crown</span></span>. </p>

<p><b>§4</b> Those who heard these words were much more enthusiastic themselves and spread the news among the others. And the generals and some of the other Greeks also came into his presence, requesting to know what they would get if they succeeded, and he sent each of them away satisfied. </p>
<p>Everyone who spoke with him urged him not to fight in person, but to take up a position behind themselves.  And at this time Clearchus asked Cyrus a question like this:  “But do you think, Cyrus, that your brother will fight you in person?" </p>
<p>“Yes, by Zeus!” Cyrus answered: “If he really is the son of Darius and Parysatis, and a brother of mine, I will not get all this without a fight.”</p>


<p class="summary">

This made the men who heard it much more <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">enthusiastic</span></span>, and those who came to Cyrus to ask how he would reward them were also <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">satisfied</span></span>. People tried to persuade Cyrus not to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">fight in person</span></span>. <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Clearchus</span></span> asked Cyrus whether he thought <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Artaxerxes</span></span> would fight him in person. Cyrus swore by <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Zeus</span></span> saying that he would not get the empire away from his<span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">brother</span></span> without a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">fight</span></span>.</p>


<p><b>§5</b> There was a count made of the armed men at this point. The Greeks totaled ten thousand four hundred hoplites and two thousand five hundred peltasts, and the barbarians with Cyrus totaled one hundred thousand along with about twenty chariots armed with scythes. The enemy forces were said to number one million two hundred thousand, with two hundred scythed chariots. There were also six thousand cavalry commanded by Artagerses, and these were drawn up in front of the king himself. Over the king’s army were four leaders and generals and commanders, each in command of three hundred thousand men: Abrocomas, Tissaphernes, Gobryas, and Arbaces.   (Nine hundred thousand of these troops  and one hundred and fifty scythed chariots were actually on hand for the battle. Abrocomas, however, arrived five days too late for the battle, having marched from Phoenicia.) This was what deserters from the king told Cyrus before the battle, and later, after the battle, those of the enemy who were captured said the same.</p>

<p class="summary">

The troops were  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">counted</span></span>. There were  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">10,400</span></span> Greek hoplites and  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">2,500</span></span> peltasts. Cyrus’s barbarian troops numbered  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">100,000</span></span>. The king’s forces were thought to number  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">1,200,000</span></span>. The king had  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">200</span></span> scythed chariots, and Cyrus had  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">20</span></span>. The king also had  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">6,000</span></span>horsemen. The king’s army had  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">four</span></span>leaders, each of whom commanded  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">300,000</span></span>men. Some of these troops were missing, though, because  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Abrocomas</span></span> was  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">5</span></span>days late for the  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">battle</span></span> because he was in  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Phoenicia</span></span>. This information came from men who had  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">deserted</span></span> the king before the battle and from  <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">enemy</span></span> soldiers who were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">captured</span></span> during the battle. </p>


<p><b>§6</b> From here Cyrus marched one day—three parasangs—with all of his troops, both Greek and barbarian, arrayed for battle. He guessed that on this day the king would give battle, for in about the middle of the march there was a huge trench. It was thirty feet across and eighteen feet deep, and it stretched inland through the plain twelve parasangs, to the wall of Media. </p>

<p><b>§7</b> Along the Euphrates there was a narrow path only twenty feet wide between the river and the trench. The Great King had made this trench instead of a wall when he learned that Cyrus was approaching. Through this passage Cyrus and his army passed and got inside the trench. So on this day the king did not engage in battle. There were, however, many footprints of horse and men in retreat. </p>

<p class="summary">

A huge <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">trench</span></span> blocking their path made Cyrus think that the king would attack that day. It was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">30</span></span> feet across, <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">18</span></span> feet deep, and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">12</span></span> parasangs long. However, Cyrus and his troops went through a narrow gap between the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">trench</span></span> and the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Euphrates</span></span> River, and the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">king</span></span> did not fight them. </p>



<p><b>§8</b> Here Cyrus called for Silanus, the Ambracian soothsayer and gave him three thousand darics. When he was sacrificing eleven days before, Silanus had told him that the king would not fight within ten days, and Cyrus had answered: “Well, then, he will not fight at all if he does not fight by then. But if you are right, I promise you ten talents.” So now, because the ten days had passed, he gave him the gold.</p>

<p class="summary">

Cyrus gave <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">3,000 darics</span></span> to a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">soothsayer</span></span> who had prophesied eleven days before that the king would not fight Cyrus for <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">ten</span></span> days. Cyrus had promised him <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">10</span></span> talents, so this seems to mean that one talent equaled <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">300</span></span> darics. </p>
<p><b>§9</b> Since the king had failed to block Cyrus's army from crossing at the trench, it seemed to Cyrus and the rest that he must have given up the idea of fighting. So the next day Cyrus traveled less cautiously, and on the third day he made his way sitting in his carriage, with few troops arrayed in front of him. Most of his army marched in confusion, and the soldiers had put much of their armor in wagons or on pack animals which they led along.</p>



<p class="summary">

Since he had not tried to stop them at the trench, Cyrus and the others thought that the king would not <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">fight</span></span> at all. Now Cyrus was less <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">cautious</span></span> and started riding in his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">carriage</span></span> without many <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">troops</span></span> in front of him. Wagons and pack animal carried the soldiers’ <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">armor</span></span> as they marched in <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">confusion</span></span>. </p>
