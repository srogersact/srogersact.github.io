<h1 class="post-title">Chapter 8: The Battle of Cunaxa</h1>

<h2>From <i>The Anabasis</i>, by Xenophon the Athenian</h2>

<p><b>§1</b> It was already about <span class="tooltip"> full market time <span class="tooltiptext"> between 9 and 10 A.M. </span></span>  and they were nearly to the place where they were going to stop, when Pategyas, a Persian and one of Cyrus's trusted friends, came into sight.  He was galloping hard, his horse bathed in sweat, and he shouted in Greek and Persian to everyone he rode by, “The king is coming with a large army ready for battle!” Then there was wild confusion, for the Greeks—and in fact everybody—thought that right then, while still out of battle order, they would be attacked. Cyrus jumped down from his chariot and put on his breastplate. Then leaping onto his horse, he took his spears in hand and sent word to all the rest to arm themselves and take their positions in their lines. </p>

<p class="summary">
Pategyas came galloping up at about <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">full market time</span></span>, shouting in <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Greek</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Persian</span></span> that the king was coming with his army. The Greeks were out of <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">battle </span></span> order, and were afraid that they would be <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">attacked</span></span> right then. Cyrus did not ride in his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chariot</span></span> to battle, instead he rode on his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">horse</span></span>. He wore his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">breastplate</span></span> and carried his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">spears</span></span>. He gave the order for everyone to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">arm</span></span> themselves and to take their <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">positions</span></span>.
</p>

<p><b>§2</b> Then they quickly got into their positions: Clearchus held the right wing by the Euphrates, Proxenus was next, the others were after him, and Menon with his troops held the left wing of the Greek troops. From the barbarian troops there were one thousand Paphlagonian cavalry standing to the right of Clearchus, along with the Greek peltasts. Ariaeus, Cyrus's second in command, and the rest of the barbarian army were on the left. Cyrus was there, also, with about six hundred cavalry, armed with breastplates, thighpieces, and helmets—all except Cyrus, who lined up for battle with his head bare. All the horses with Cyrus wore frontlets and breast-pieces, and the cavalry carried Greek sabers.</p>

<p class="summary">
This is how Cyrus’s army lined up. The Euphrates River was on the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">right</span></span>. <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Clearchus </span></span> and his troops were next to the river. The next <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> general </span></span> was Proxenus. On the left of the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Greek troops </span></span> was Menon. Clearchus was not right next to the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Euphrates River </span></span> because the Paphlagonian cavalry was in between it and Clearchus, and so were the Greek <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> peltasts</span></span>. On the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> left</span></span>  of the Greek armies were the rest of the barbarian army, led by Cyrus’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> second in command </span></span>, Ariaeus. Cyrus was there with about 600 <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> cavalry </span></span>. Everyone wore <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> armor </span></span>, but Cyrus did not have on a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> helmet </span></span>.
</p>

<p><b>§3</b> By mid-day the enemy was not yet in sight. But in the early afternoon dust like a white cloud appeared, and after quite a while it became like some blackness stretching a long distance across the plain. And as they drew nearer, suddenly bronze flashed and the spear-points and the ranks of the enemy forces became clearly visible. </p>
<p><b>§4</b> On the enemy’s left were horsemen in white breastplates, and Tissaphernes was said to be in command of them. Next were men with wicker-shields. Next were hoplites (said to be Egyptians) with long wooden shields reaching to their feet. Then came more cavalry and archers. All of them marched nation by nation, each nation in a solid rectangle. In front of them was a line of chariots spaced widely apart from each other—the famous “scythe-chariots.” They had scythes attached to the wheel hubs that stuck out sideways and scythes pointed towards the ground from under the chariot-seats that cut to pieces anything in their way. The intention was to drive them into the ranks of the Greeks and cut them to pieces.</p>

<p class="summary">
The first indication that the enemy was approaching was the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> white dust </span></span>, which eventually became a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> blackness </span></span>. They could actually see their enemy when the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> bronze </span></span> of their armor flashed. On the king’s side were horsemen commanded by <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Tissaphernes </span></span>, men with <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> wicker </span></span> shields, Egyptian <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> hoplites </span></span>, and archers. In front of them were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> chariots </span></span> mounted with <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> scythes </span></span> .
</p>

<p><b>§5</b> What Cyrus had said, though, at the war council—when he had urged the Greeks to bear up under the shout of the barbarians—turned out to be mistaken:  for not with a shout but as silently as possible they advanced, and with slow, measured steps. </p>
<p> At this moment, Cyrus himself rode past with Pigres, his interpreter, and three or four others. He shouted to Clearchus to lead his army against the enemy’s center, because that was where the king was. “And if we win there,” he said, “our work is finished.” </p>

<p class="summary">
Cyrus was mistaken because the barbarians did not <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> shout </span></span> but marched <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> silent </span></span>ly and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> slow </span></span>ly. Cyrus wanted Clearchus to take his army to where the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> king </span></span> was and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> win </span></span> the whole battle by <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> winning </span></span> there.
</p>


<p><b>§6</b> Clearchus was reluctant, though. On the one hand, he saw the enemy’s crowded center and heard from Cyrus that the king was outside their left wing. (The king’s army outnumbered Cyrus’s so much that, while commanding the center of his own army, he was beyond the left of Cyrus’s army!).  On the other hand, Clearchus did not want to pull the right wing away from the river, for fear of being completely surrounded. So he replied to Cyrus that he would make sure things went well.</p>

<p class="summary">
Clearchus, though, was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> afraid </span></span>. For one thing, the king’s line of soldiers was more than <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> twice </span></span> as long as Cyrus’s. Also, if Clearchus moved away from <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> the river </span></span> , he might be <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> surrounded </span></span> completely. 
</p>

<p><b>§7</b> Even now the barbarian army was steadily advancing, while the Greek army stayed where it was and was still getting into order. Cyrus rode past at some distance from his own army and examined each side, looking at his enemies and his friends. Xenophon the Athenian saw him, rode up from the Greek quarter to meet him, and asked him whether he had any orders to give. Cyrus pulled up his horse and told him to tell everyone that the omens from both the regular sacrifice and the special sacrifice were good. </p>
<p><b>§8</b> While he was saying this, he heard a murmur passing through the ranks, and asked Xenophon what it was. He replied that it was the watchword being passed along for the second time. Cyrus wondered who had given the order, and asked what the watchword was. </p>
<p>“Zeus our Savior and Victory,” Xenophon replied. </p>
<p>“Well, I approve,” Cyrus said. “So let it be!” And with that remark he rode away to his own position.</p>

<p class="summary">
This is the first time we see <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Xenophon </span></span> the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Athenian </span></span> in action. We notice that he has a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> horse </span></span> because he rides out to talk to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Cyrus </span></span>, who is also on a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> horse </span></span> and is looking at the two <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> armies </span></span> on opposite sides. Xenophon asks Cyrus if he has any <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> orders </span></span>. Cyrus says to tell everyone that the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> omens </span></span> were good. When Cyrus is curious hearing the sound of the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> watchword </span></span> passing through the troops a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> second </span></span> time, Xenophon tells Cyrus that the watchword is “<span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Zeus </span></span> our Savior and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Victory </span></span>.” Cyrus approves and rides off.
</p>

<p><b>§9</b>  The two battle lines were now no more than six or eight hundred yards apart, when the Greeks sang the paean and advanced to meet the enemy.</p>


<p><b>§10</b> As they began to go forward, however, part of the line surged ahead, and the part left behind began to run. At the same time, everyone yelled the kind of battle cry they yell in honor of the War God—“Eleleu!”—and everyone was running. Some say they also clashed their shields and spears, panicking the horses. Before an arrow could reach them, the barbarians gave way and fled. And now the Greeks certainly chased with all their might, though they shouted to each other not to run but to keep their ranks as they followed. The empty chariots rushed through the enemy themselves as well as through the Greeks, who opened ranks when they saw them coming. One guy, however, was hit like some terrified spectator on a racecourse. But they said that not even he was injured. Nor was any other Greek injured at all in this battle, except someone on the left wing who was said to have been hit by an arrow.</p>

<p class="summary">
The Greeks sang something called the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> paean </span></span> before going into battle. To honor the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> War God </span></span>as they ran into battle they yelled as a battle cry, <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> “Eleleu!” </span></span> The horses were <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> panicked </span></span>, and the barbarians <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> fled </span></span>. The <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">Greeks </span></span> tried to keep their ranks as they chased the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> barbarians </span></span>. The <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> chariots </span></span> were empty and did not injure anyone. No Greeks were injured except one man on the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> left wing </span></span> who was hit by <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> an arrow </span></span>.
</p>



<p><b>§11</b> Cyrus was happy when he saw the Greeks beating their opponents and chasing them, and he was already being bowed down to as king by those around him. He did not, however, get caught up in the excitement and join the chase. Instead, keeping his squadron of six hundred cavalry together in close formation, he watched to see what the king would do. He was sure that the king held the center of the Persian army, since all barbarian kings hold the center when commanding their forces. They reason that they are in the safest place if their own forces are on either side, and that, if they need to give a command, it will take half as long from here for the army to receive it. Although the king indeed held the center of his army on this occasion as was usual, still he was outside Cyrus’s left wing. And since no one from the opposite side fought him or the troops in front of him, <span class="tooltip">he<span class="tooltiptext"> the king </span></span> began to wheel so he could encircle <span class="tooltip">them<span class="tooltiptext"> Cyrus’s army</span></span>.  </p>

<p class="summary">
Although he was <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> happy </span></span> when he saw the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> Greeks </span></span> chasing their opponents, Cyrus kept his <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> cavalry </span></span> together and did not join the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> chase </span></span>. He kept watching <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> the king </span></span> to see what he would do. The king’s forces that extended beyond Cyrus’s army began to turn inward to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> encircle </span></span> Cyrus’s army. 
</p>

<p><b>§12</b> Then, fearing that the king would get behind the Greek force and cut them to pieces, Cyrus charged to meet him. Not only did he and his six hundred attack and beat the troops positioned in front of the king and rout the six thousand, he himself is said to have killed with his own hand their general, Artagerses. </p>
<p><b>§13</b> But when it became a rout, Cyrus's six hundred themselves were scattered as they rode off in pursuit, leaving very few around him except the ones called his table companions. Left alone with these, he spotted the king and the mass of troops around him. Instantly out of control, he yelled, "I see the man!" He threw himself at him and struck him in the chest, wounding him through his breastplate. (This is what Ctesias the surgeon says, and that he himself healed the wound.) </p>

Cyrus charged because was afraid that the king’s <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> army </span></span> would get behind his own <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> army </span></span>. Cyrus had only<span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> six hundred </span></span> troops with him, but they beat the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> six thousand </span></span>  troops with the king and started to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> chase </span></span>them. Only a few <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">table companions </span></span> were left with Cyrus. When Cyrus saw <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> the king </span></span>, he lost <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> control </span></span> of himself, yelling, <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> “I see the man!” </span></span> and throwing himself at <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> the king </span></span> even though there were many <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext"> troops </span></span> around <span class="tooltip">him<span class="tooltiptext">the king </span></span>.

</p>

<p><b>§14</b> As Cyrus struck, someone speared him hard with a javelin under the eye. Ctesias tells how many of those around the king died when Cyrus and the king and their companions on either side fought, since he was there with the king.  But Cyrus himself was killed, and his eight bravest companions were laid dead on him. It is said that Artapates, the most faithful of his scepter-bearers, when he saw Cyrus fallen, leapt down from his horse to throw his arms around him. And some say that the king ordered someone to slay him on top of Cyrus, but others say that Artapates slew himself there with his own <span class="tooltip">scimitar<span class="tooltiptext">a short, curved sword </span></span>. For he had a gold one—and he wore a collar and bracelets and other things such as the noblest Persians wear—for he had been honored by Cyrus for his friendship and faithfulness.</p>
