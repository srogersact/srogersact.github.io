<!-- <p>Any substance that has mass and takes up space is called <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">matter</span></span>. It can occur as <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">an element</span></span>, in which all the atoms have the same number of protons. It can also occur as <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">a compound</span></span>, in which all the molecules are the same though they each contain more than one element. An element or compound that is not mixed with other elements or compounds is called <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">a pure</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">substance</span></span> and has definite properties. </p>

<p><span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">A physical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">property</span></span> is a property observed or measured without changing the identity or composition of a substance. For example, you can measure the mass or volume of a substance. Since these properties—mass and volume—change depending on the amount of substance present, they are called <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">extensive</span></span>. </p>

<p>If a property does not depend on the amount of substance present, it is called <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">intensive</span></span>. The ratio of mass to volume, the <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">density</span></span>, always stays the same so it is an <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">intensive</span></span> property. A second property that does not depend on the amount of substance present is color:  you can observe a substance’s color without causing any change in the substance. A third <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">intensive</span></span> property is whether a substance is <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">magnetic</span></span> (has an attraction to magnets).  Do you think <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">odor</span></span> (distinctive smell) is an intensive or an extensive physical property? </p>

<p>Often you can identify a substance by observing a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">physical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">change</span></span>, a change that does not affect the substance’s chemical composition. For example you can heat or cool a substance to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">determine</span></span> (find out) the temperature at which a substance’s state of matter changes between liquid and gas. This is called its <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">boiling</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">point</span></span>. As you probably remember, water boils at 100°C. Acetone is a clear liquid that looks like water, but it boils at a much lower temperature, 56°C. The temperature at which a substance’s state of matter changes between solid and liquid, its <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">melting</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">point</span></span>, is also important. Ice (solid water) melts at 0°C, but solid acetone turns to liquid acetone at the much colder temperature of -95°C. Freezing, melting, boiling, and condensing do not change a substance’s chemical composition. Water, for example, stays water during those changes, and acetone remains acetone. </p>

<p>Another <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">physical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">change</span></span> that you can observe without affecting a substance’s chemical composition is its <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">solubility</span></span>. This is a measurement of the ability of a solid to dissolve in a liquid. The kind of salt you put on your food at the dinner table is <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">sodium</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chloride</span></span>. It dissolves in water, and so does sugar. Pour a glass of pure water, then measure to see how much salt (<span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">sodium</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chloride</span></span>) can be stirred in until no more dissolves. Now pour another glass using an equal amount of pure water—and make sure it’s the same temperature. Now measure to see how much sugar can be stirred in until no more dissolves.  One of these two substances is more <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">soluble</span></span> in water, which means you can dissolve more of it in the same amount of water. </p>

<p>Now that you have mixed salt (<span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">sodium</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chloride</span></span>) and water or sugar and water, you have a special <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">mixture</span></span> called a solution. The solution’s physical properties will be somewhat different from those of pure water. For example, salt water’s melting point is different from the melting point of pure water. The boiling point of salt water is also different from pure water’s, and so is the density. Melting point, boiling point, and density will change (be <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">variable</span></span>) depending on how much salt is in the solution. When we change the ratio of salt to water, the resulting changes in melting point, boiling point, and density can be known or predicted in advance—they are <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">predictable</span></span> changes. Since they are, we can use these <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">physical</span></span> properties to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">determine</span></span> (find out) how much salt is in a saltwater solution. We can do the same with a sugar-water solution, too. </p>

<p>A <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">mixture</span></span> can be separated using physical means. If you mixed salt and pepper, you could separate the pepper from salt by hand—if you had enough time and some tweezers! In that case you would be using a physical property, color, to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">determine</span></span> which is salt and which is pepper. If you had a mixture of iron filings and pepper, you could separate them by making use of the fact that iron filings are attracted to magnets—they are <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">magnetic</span></span>—and pepper is not.  Another physical property you can use for separating a mixture is boiling point. Water evaporates at a much lower temperature than salt. (Imagine how hot salt would have to be to melt, let alone to start boiling!) If you boil a saltwater solution, the water will evaporate but the salt will be left in the bottom of the pan. With some mixtures you can use a more sophisticated method of separation. It makes use of differences in <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">solubility</span></span> (how easily a substance dissolves) and adsorption (how much a substance is attracted to a surface). This method is called <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chromato-graphy</span></span>. It means “writing with color” and was named that since one of its first uses was in separating pigments (the colors) from plant leaves. (“Chroma” means “color.”) </p>

<p>So far we have only considered <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">physical</span></span> changes and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">physical</span></span> properties. Again, these do not involve changes in the kinds of molecules in a substance. Water molecules are still water molecules, whether you freeze them or boil them. And if you mix <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">sodium</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chloride</span></span> (salt) and water, you still have salt and water. The molecules have mixed but they have not joined together to <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">compose</span></span> bigger molecules, nor have they <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">decomposed</span></span> to make smaller molecules. </p>

<p>A <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chemical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">change</span></span>, on the other hand, is a change resulting in the formation of a new substance—the original molecules are transformed, and a new kind of molecule is formed. A chemical change <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">consumes</span></span> (uses up, destroys) the reactants and <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">creates</span></span> new products. </p>

<p>A <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chemical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">property</span></span> describes how a substance interacts with other materials. This includes any possible chemical change that a substance can go through.  A <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chemical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">property</span></span> can only be observed or measured when atoms in molecules rearrange during a <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">chemical</span></span> <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">change</span></span>. </p>

<p>One chemical property is <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">flammability</span></span>, how easily a substance burns. As mentioned before, acetone looks like water. Water does not burn at all, but acetone is extremely <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">flammable</span></span>. If you were expecting acetone to act like water and put out a fire, you would be in for a dangerous surprise! </p>

<p>The ability of a substance to react with other substances, its <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">reactivity</span></span>, is an important chemical characteristic. The fact that water does not burn means that oxygen does not react with water. Sodium chloride does not react with water either. The element sodium, however, reacts violently with water. Other substances have dangerously violent reactions with water, too. There are also substances that are harmful because they are <span class="tooltip">__________<span class="tooltiptext">corrosive</span></span>, or able to destroy materials such as metal or stone (or skin!) on contact by chemical action. </p>
