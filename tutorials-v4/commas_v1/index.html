<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;Goal 1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Using commas in compound sentences.</h2>
<p>A compound sentence really just two or more sentences joined together. </p>
Here are two sentences:
  <!-- <p>Analysis Example 1</p>  -->

        <p class="problem">The first story is about a gnat and a lion. The second story is about a gnat and a bull.</p>

  <p>Look carefully to see how we join those two sentences using a comma and a coordinating conjunction:</p>

        <p class="solution">The first story is about a gnat and a lion, and the second story is about a gnat and a bull.</p>

  <br>Now try that yourself!

  <h3>Compound Sentence Problem 1</h3>


    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>

  <h3>Compound Sentence Problem 2</h3>

    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>

  <h3>Compound Sentence Problem 3</h3>
The sentences that are joined can be long. Be sure to include everything from each sentence. 
    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>

  <h3>Compound Sentence Problem 4</h3>
Can you find the end of the first clause? That is where the comma should go.
    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>


  <h3>Compound Sentence Problem 5</h3>
So far we have only used <strong>and</strong> as our coordinating conjunction. Some other coordinating conjunctions include <strong>but, so, </strong> and <strong>yet</strong>. 
<br>The comma should go right after the first clause and <em>before</em> the conjunction.
    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>

  <h3>Compound Sentence Problem 6</h3>
Find the end of the first clause. The comma should go right after the first clause and <em>before</em> the conjunction.
    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>

<h3>Compound Sentence Problem 7</h3>
Find the end of the first clause. The comma should go right after the first clause and <em>before</em> the conjunction.
    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;Goal 2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using commas in quotations.</h2>

<br>Commas are also used in quotations.
<br>If a speaker tag comes before a quotation, a comma follows the speaker tag.
<br>Look at where the comma is in this example:

        <p class="solution">The lion said, "Leave me alone, you pesky gnat!"</p>
  <br>Now try that yourself!
  <!-- <br> --> 
  <h3>Quotation Problem 1</h3>


    <div class="you_try composition">
    </div>
<br>If a speaker tag comes after a quotation, a comma follows the quotation. The comma goes <em>before</em> the final quotation marks.
<br>Look at where the comma is in this example:

        <p class="solution">"You are such a braggart," the lion muttered.</p>

  <h3>Quotation Problem 2</h3>

<div class="you_try composition">
</div>

<br>If a speaker tag comes after a quotation that ends with a question mark or exclamation point, <em>do not add a comma</em> before the final quotation marks.
<br>Look at this example:

        <p class="solution">"Why are you pestering me?" the lion whimpered.</p>
  
And this example:

        <p class="solution">"Leave me alone!" the lion bellowed.</p>
  
  <h3>Quotation Problem 3</h3>
  Add a comma, remove a comma, or move the punctuation to where it belongs.

<div class="you_try composition">
</div>


  <h3>Quotation Problem 4</h3>
  Add a comma, remove a comma, or move the punctuation to where it belongs.

<div class="you_try composition">
</div>

 <h3>Quotation Problem 5</h3>
  Add a comma, remove a comma, or move the punctuation to where it belongs.

<div class="you_try composition">
</div>

 <h3>Quotation Problem 6</h3>
  Add a comma, remove a comma, or move the punctuation to where it belongs.

<div class="you_try composition">
</div>

 <h3>Quotation Problem 7</h3>
  Add a comma, remove a comma, or move the punctuation to where it belongs.
