<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing a Compound Sentence</h2>

<p>Here is a compound sentence:</p>

<p class="problem">A robin is a bird, and a cat is a mammal.</p>

<p>This sentence can be analyzed as two sentences.

    <br>You simply...
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Take out the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>. </li>
        <li>Start your sentences with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p class="solution">A robin is a bird. A cat is a mammal.</p>

<p>That is super easy, don't you think?
    <br>
    <br>Here is another simple example:
</p>

<p class="problem">A horse is a kind of mammal, <span class="tooltip">and<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction.</span></span> a crocodile is a kind of reptile.</p>


<p> Again, you just...
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Take out the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>. </li>
        <li>Start your sentences with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">A horse is a kind of mammal. A crocodile is a kind of reptile.</p>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing a Compound Sentence</h2>
<p>In Grammar Effects you can learn how to <em>compose</em> sentences. It's just the opposite of <em>analyzing</em>. </p>
<div class="defining_text">
    In Grammar Effects...
    <ul>
        <li>To <em>compose</em> a sentence, you join simple sentences together. This will make a more complicated sentence.</li>

    </ul>

</div>
<p>Here are two sentences:</p>

<p class="problem">Mammals breathe with lungs. Fish breathe with gills.</p>

<p>These sentences can be composed as one compound sentence. </p>
<p> Here is what you do:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the period at the end of the first sentence into a comma. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction.<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have extra capitals in your sentence.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Mammals breathe with lungs, <span class="tooltip">and<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction.</span></span> fish breathe with gills.</p>

<p>That's super easy, too, don't you think?</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<p class="problem">Frogs often have color patterns that make them hard to see. Some insects have shapes that make them look like sticks or leaves. </p>

<p>These are longer sentences. Do they make you nervous? Just remember these simple directions:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the period at the end of the first sentence into a comma. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> after the comma.</li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have unnecessary capitals in your sentence.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Frogs often have color patterns that make them hard to see, and some insects have shapes that make them look like sticks or leaves.</p>

<p>We changed the period to a comma.
    <br>
    <br>We added "and."

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing Compound Sentences with Three or More Clauses</h2>
<!-- <p>Have you ever thought about why writers even use compound sentences? Let's think about that in a little bit. --></p>
<p>Sometimes a sentence has three or more <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span>:</p>

<p class="problem">A monkey is a mammal that climbs in trees, a dolphin is a mammal that swims in the ocean, and a bat is a mammal that flies through the air.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first clause is <span class="problem_quote"> A monkey is a mammal that climbs in trees.</span></li>
    <li>The second clause is <span class="problem_quote"> A dolphin is a mammal that swims in the ocean.</span></li>
    <li>The third clause is <span class="problem_quote"> A bat is a mammal that flies through the air.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Now it is easy to see that the compound sentence was really just a list of sentences. </p>
<p>A compound sentence with three or more clauses is easy to analyze:

    <ul>
        <li>Change the commas into periods. </li>
        <li>Remove the conjunction. </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">A monkey is a mammal that climbs in trees. A dolphin is a mammal that swims in the ocean. A bat is a mammal that flies in the air.</p>

<p>A sentence can also have four, five, or more sentences.
    <br>If you focus on just one of those sentences at a time, it will be easier to understand.
    <br>
</p>

<p>Now let's think about why writers use compound sentences. Did you notice anything about the three sentences that were joined together to make one sentence?
    <ul>
        <li>The first clause is about a monkey. This clause tells us what a monkey is (a mammal) what it does (climbs) and where it is found (in trees).</li>
        <li>The second clause is about a dolphin. This clause tells us what a dolphin is (also a mammal)  what it does (swims) and where it is found (in the ocean).</li>
        <li>The third clause is about a bat. This clause tells us what a bat is (this is a mammal, too!) and where it is found (in the air).</li>
    </ul>
    Each of the sentences is about a mammal. Each of the sentences tells us the same three things about a different mammal:
    <ol>
        <li>the name of the mammal, </li>
        <li>what the mammal does, </li>
        <li>where the mammal is found. </li>
    </ol>
    The sentences compare the three mammals. <strong>Compound sentences are often used to to show that we are comparing things.</strong>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing Compound Sentences with Three or More Clauses</h2>

<p>Sometimes you have three or more sentences that go together:</p>

<p class="problem">Whales migrate between the tropics and the arctic. Salmon migrate between streams and oceans. Elk migrate between mountains and valleys.</p>

<p>Do you see why these sentences go together? 
     <ul>
        <li>The sentences compare <span class="tooltip">three kinds of animal<span class="tooltiptext">Whales, salmon, and elk.</span></span> that <span class="tooltip">migrate<span class="tooltiptext"> To migrate means to move from one place to another when the season changes.</span></span>. </li>
        <li>The sentences also compare <span class="tooltip">three kinds of migration.<span class="tooltiptext">Between the tropics and the arctic, between streams and oceans, and between mountains and valleys.</span></span> </li>
    </ul>

<p>It depends on your point of view.</p>


<p> It is easy to compose a compound sentence using these three sentences. Here is what you do:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the periods at the ends of the sentences into commas&mdash;except for the period at the end of the very last sentence. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> before the very last sentence. </li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have capitals in the middle of your sentence if they don't need to be there.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="solution">Whales migrate between the tropics and the arctic, salmon migrate between streams and oceans, and elk migrate between mountains and valleys.</p>

<p>Notice that we use commas where the first two periods went.</p>
<!-- Special Note -->
<div class="defining_text">
    <h3 class="defining_text">Use the Oxford Comma:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In this work you will always put a comma before the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> at the end of a list.</li>
        <li>This is what is called the <em>"Oxford comma."</em></li>
        <li>Some people prefer to leave out the Oxford comma. That's perfectly okay...</li>
 
    &#10071;&nbsp;...BUT you will have to use the Oxford comma in the "Try It Yourself" exercises.</em> Otherwise, they won't work.

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-3&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing Even Longer Compound Sentences</h2>

<p>Before we talk about this next sentence, why don't you count to see how many <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> it has.
</p>

<p class="problem">Frogs hibernate in lake bottoms, turtles hibernate in ponds, chipmunks hibernate in nests of leaves, and black bears hibernate in burned out logs.</p>

<p>How many clauses did you count?  <span class="tooltip">Hover here for the answer.<span class="tooltiptext">It's four clauses.</span></span></p>

<p>Look back and see whether you think each clause is difficult.</p>

<p>Here is that same sentence analyzed into four sentences:</p>

<p class="solution">Frogs hibernate in lake bottoms. Turtles hibernate in ponds. Chipmunks hibernate in nests of leaves. Black bears hibernate in burned out logs.</p>

<p>If you read each sentence one at a time, they are pretty easy to understand.</p>
<p>The sentences all do the same thing: each sentence names an animal and tells where it hibernates. Authors often join together a list of similar sentences to make a compound sentence. It is a very common grammar effect.</p>
<p>Using this grammar effect, you can break some pretty large sentences into smaller sentences that are easier to understand.</p>

<p>How many <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> are listed here?</p>

<p class="problem">Fish are covered with scales. Frogs are covered with soft skin. Birds are covered with feathers. Mammals are covered with hair.</p>

<p>Either way, good job!</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> is about a kind of animal and what it is covered with.

<p class="solution">Fish are covered with scales, frogs are covered with soft skin, birds are covered with feathers, and mammals are covered with hair.</p>

<p>Each of the <span class="tooltip">clauses<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span> is short, but the compound sentence we made out of them has 22 words. That makes it a pretty long sentence.</p>

<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-4&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Marking a Contrast</h2>

<p>So far we have been writing compound sentences that use "and" as the conjunction. These sentences have been showing how things are similar.</p>
<p>Now we will think about compound sentences that emphasize how things are different.</p>

<p class="problem">Frogs have soft, moist skin, but lizards have dry, scaly skin.</p>

<p>This compound sentence is showing how frogs are different from lizards.</p>
<p>It may be easier to notice the contrast if we analyze the sentence into its clauses:</p>

<p class="solution">Frogs have soft, moist skin. However, lizards have dry, scaly skin.</p>

<p>Did you notice that word, "However"? We can use it to replace the word, "but."</p>

<p>The contrast is between most reptiles and snakes (which are a type of reptile).</p>
<!--   <p>The word "However" is used in the second sentence. Notice that it is followed by a comma.</p> -->
<p>The word "However" is used to show the contrast. If we join the two sentences, we will use "but" as the conjunction. The word "but" shows contrast.</p>

<p>This sentence is a little longer, and it only has two clauses. Each of those clauses is longer and more complicated than the ones you have dealt with so far.</p>
<p>That's okay. We will just do the same things we've been doing:
