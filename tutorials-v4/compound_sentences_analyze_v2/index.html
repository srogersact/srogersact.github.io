<!-- Introduction -->

<!-- Special Note -->
<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
In this set of exercises you will analyze a few kinds of sentences. Analyze means "split." 
<br>
<br>For compound sentences, you will do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Get rid of the <span class="tooltip">conjunction <span class="tooltiptext"><u>and</u>, <u>but</u>, or <u>or</u></span></span> that joins the sentences.</li>
  <li>You will make the comma into a period.</li>
  <li>You will capitalize the first word of each sentence. </li>
  <li>You will replace <strong>but</strong> with <strong>However,</strong>&mdash; be sure to include that comma after "However."</li>
  <li><u>Sometimes</u> when you have <strong>or</strong> as the conjunction, you will add <strong>also</strong> after <strong>might</strong> and before the <strong>main verb</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Analysis 1 -->
<h3>Problem 1</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">

  <h3>Problem 2</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">
    </div>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
It is really important to know what to do with an <strong>appositive</strong>. 
Look at the following example:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="problem">When we learn about ancient technology, we study materials, the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things.</p>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
The appositive in this sentence is <strong>"the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things"</strong>. 
<br>Now look at how to make that sentence into two sentences:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="solution">When we learn about ancient technology, we study materials. Materials are the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things.</p>

  <h3>Problem 3</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">
    </div>

  <h3>Problem 4</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">
    </div>
<hr><br>
<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Sometimes</u> when you have <strong>or</strong> as the conjunction, you will add <strong>also</strong> after <strong>might</strong> and before the <strong>main verb</strong>.

</div>

<h3>Problem 5</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">
    </div>

  <h3>Problem 6</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">
    </div>
<hr><br>
<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Sometimes an <strong>appositive</strong> is in the middle of the sentence. 
Look at the following example:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="problem">Materials, the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things, are an important subject.</p>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
The appositive in this sentence is still <strong>"the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things."</strong>
<br>Now look carefully at how to make <em>that</em> sentence into two sentences:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="solution">Materials are an important subject. Materials are the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things.</p>
  <h3>Problem 7</h3>

    <div class="you_try analysis">
    </div>
<hr><br>
<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Sometimes you will want to move the sentences around. 
<br>Now look carefully at how these two sets of sentences that are ordered differently:
</div>

        <p class="problem">Materials are an important subject. Materials are the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things.</p>
        <p class="solution">Materials are the different kinds of stuff that are used to make things. Materials are an important subject. </p>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
<strong>Hint:</strong> The next problem is a chance to apply what you just read.

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Sometimes <strong>who</strong> introduces a clause. 
Look at the following example:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="problem">You may have met my uncle, who worked as a dentist.</p>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Now look carefully at how to make <em>that</em> sentence into two sentences:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="solution">You may have met my uncle. My uncle worked as a dentist.</p>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Sometimes <strong>where</strong> introduces a clause. 
Look at the following example:

        <p class="problem">We went to Seattle, where we visited Pike Place Market.</p>

<div class="defining_text" style="font-size: 125%">
Now look carefully at how to make <em>that</em> sentence into two sentences:

<!-- Hint:  It may be helpful to review "<a href="/tutorials-v4/compound_sentences_analyze/index.html">Analyzing Compound Sentences</a>." -->
</div>

        <p class="solution">We went to Seattle. In Seattle we visited Pike Place Market.</p>
