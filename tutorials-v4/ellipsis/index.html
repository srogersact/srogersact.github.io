<h1 class="post-title">Ellipsis: Leaving Words Out</h1>

<!-- Introduction -->
<p style="font-size: 125%">Sometimes writers leave words out. They expect their readers to know which words are left out. </p>
<!-- Special Note -->
<p style="font-size: 125%">
The following sentence has a word that is left out in the second phrase: 
</p>

<p class="problem">A robin is a kind of bird, and a cat a kind of mammal.</p>

<p style="font-size: 125%">
Do you see the word that is left out in the second phrase?  The writer did that on purpose.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 125%">
Here is the same compound sentence but with the word that was left out:
</p>

<p class="solution">A robin is a kind of bird, and a cat is a kind of mammal.</p>

<p style="font-size: 125%">

That is super easy, don't you think?
</p>
