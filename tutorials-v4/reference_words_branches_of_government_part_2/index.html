<p>A constitution is a plan for a government.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> It<span class="tooltiptext"> The constitution </span></span> says what a government is supposed to do.</p>
<p>Even small local governments have <span class="tooltip"> their<span class="tooltiptext"> local governments' </span></span>  own constitutions.</p>
<p>One way state constitutions are alike is that all of <span class="tooltip"> them<span class="tooltiptext"> the state constitutions </span></span>  call for three branches of government.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> These<span class="tooltiptext"> The three branches of government </span></span>  are the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch.</p>
<p>All three of <span class="tooltip"> them <span class="tooltiptext"> the branches of government </span></span>  are supposed to have the same amount of power.</p>
<p>Each of <span class="tooltip"> them <span class="tooltiptext"> the branches of government </span></span>  has jobs to do.</p>
<p>The executive branch includes the governor, <span class="tooltip"> his or her<span class="tooltiptext"> the governor's </span></span>  staff, the lieutenant governor, and the secretary of state. </p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> It<span class="tooltiptext"> The executive branch </span></span>  is led by the governor.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> He or she<span class="tooltiptext"> The governor </span></span>  is elected by the citizens of the state.</p>
<p>The governor of a state sets a budget that controls how <span class="tooltip"> its<span class="tooltiptext"> the state's </span></span>  money is spent.</p>
<p>The governor's position in the state government is similar to <span class="tooltip"> that<span class="tooltiptext"> the position </span></span>  of the president in the national government.</p>
<p>The governor is like the president because the governor has to approve new laws for <span class="tooltip"> them<span class="tooltiptext"> the new laws </span></span>  to go into effect.</p>
<p>The legislative branch of a state writes <span class="tooltip"> its<span class="tooltiptext"> the state's </span></span>   laws.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> Its<span class="tooltiptext"> The legislative branch's </span></span>  members are elected by the voters of a state.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> They<span class="tooltiptext"> The members of the legislative branch </span></span>  can be either senators or representatives.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> These people<span class="tooltiptext"> The members of the legislative branch </span></span>  are called legislators.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> Their<span class="tooltiptext"> The legislators' </span></span>  job is similar to the job of the legislature at the federal level.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> This<span class="tooltiptext"> The legislature at the federal level </span></span>  is called the United States Congress.</p>
<p>The third branch of a state government is the judicial branch.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> It<span class="tooltiptext"> The judicial branch </span></span>  includes judges who use the laws of the state to make decisions.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> They<span class="tooltiptext"> The judges </span></span>  can be elected by voters or appointed by governors.</p>
<p>Judges decide whether laws follow the state constitution and whether <span class="tooltip"> they<span class="tooltiptext"> the laws </span></span>  are being applied fairly.</p>
