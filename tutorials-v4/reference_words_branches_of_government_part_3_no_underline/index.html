<p>All three branches of a state's government are there to help <span class="tooltip"> its<span class="tooltiptext"> a state's</span></span> citizens.</p>
<p>A state government works in four basic areas to <span class="tooltip"> do this<span class="tooltiptext"> help the state's citizens</span></span>.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> These<span class="tooltiptext"> These four basic areas</span></span> are transportation, public health and safety, education, and emergency and disaster relief.</p>
<p>Taking care of transportation is important to a state because <span class="tooltip"> this<span class="tooltiptext">transportation</span></span> greatly affects a state's citizens.</p>
<p>A state's roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and ferry systems connect <span class="tooltip"> its<span class="tooltiptext"> the state's</span></span>  citizens.</p>
<p>The state government has to maintain <span class="tooltip">them<span class="tooltiptext"> the state's roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and ferry systems </span></span>  so people can get to work.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> They<span class="tooltiptext"> They state's roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and ferry systems </span></span>  allow people to travel safely and goods to be transported safely.</p>
<p>People who work for the state build <span class="tooltip"> these important parts of a state's infrastructure. <span class="tooltiptext"> the state's roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and ferry systems </span></span></p>
<p>People who work for the state also maintain <span class="tooltip"> them<span class="tooltiptext"> the state's roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and ferry systems </span></span>.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> This work<span class="tooltiptext"> building and maintaining the state's roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and ferry systems</span></span> is paid for by taxes, fees, and tolls.</p>
<p>States collect <span class="tooltip"> this money<span class="tooltiptext"> the taxes, fees, and tolls</span></span>  from citizens.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> This<span class="tooltiptext"> Collecting the taxes, fees, and tolls from citizens</span></span>  is an important responsibility for any government because people have to be paid to do the work.</p>
<p> Keeping the people of a state healthy and safe is another important job for <span class="tooltip"> its<span class="tooltiptext"> the state's</span></span>  government.</p>
<p>State police and state hospitals are just two examples of how a state <span class="tooltip"> does this<span class="tooltiptext"> keeps the people of the state healthy and safe</span></span>.</p>
<p>States also have the job of educating <span class="tooltip"> their<span class="tooltiptext"> the states'</span></span>  children.</p>
<p>About half of the money for public schools comes from state governments, and the rest of <span class="tooltip"> it<span class="tooltiptext"> the money for public schools</span></span>  comes from local governments and the federal government.</p>
<p>School districts use <span class="tooltip"> this money<span class="tooltiptext"> the money for public schools</span></span>  to build and maintain schools, pay teachers, and buy books and other supplies.</p>
<p>State colleges and universities are also paid for with money from the state.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> These<span class="tooltiptext"> State colleges and universities</span></span>  are often less expensive than private colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The last example of how a state's government helps citizens is the help <span class="tooltip"> it<span class="tooltiptext"> a state</span></span>  gives after a disaster or in an emergency.</p>
<p>State workers and volunteers give help to people after a hurricane or an earthquake.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> They<span class="tooltiptext"> State workers and volunteers</span></span>  can rescue people who have been injured or are lost.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> They<span class="tooltiptext"> State workers and volunteers</span></span>  can also help clean up after a disaster.</p>
<p>The state government can help people be prepared for <span class="tooltip"> these kinds of events<span class="tooltiptext"> hurricanes, earthquakes, and disasters</span></span>  in the future.</p>
<p>The governments of several states can work together when one of <span class="tooltip"> them<span class="tooltiptext"> the states</span></span>  is in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>One example of <span class="tooltip"> this<span class="tooltiptext"> the governments of several states working together to help another state in an emergency situation</span></span>  was when a few states helped New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>The federal government also works with states when <span class="tooltip"> they<span class="tooltiptext"> the states</span></span>  experience emergencies.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> It<span class="tooltiptext"> The federal government</span></span>  gives financial aid to help states build new homes and rebuild businesses.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip"> This<span class="tooltiptext"> The federal government giving financial aid to help states build new homes and rebuild businesses</span></span>  is an example of federalism at <span class="tooltip">its<span class="tooltiptext"> federalism's</span></span>  best.</p>
