<p>We were not sure when the first small <span class="tooltip">vibrations<span class="tooltiptext">tremors</span></span> began, but for days we knew that something big was about to happen.
</p>

<p><span class="tooltip">The Earth's crust could move and cause sudden, powerful shaking of the ground! <span class="tooltiptext">an earthquake!</span></span>
</p>

<p>Many of the nearby <span class="tooltip">natural features of the Earth's surface<span class="tooltiptext">landforms</span></span> showed that there had been much activity here.
</p>

<p>We also knew that our state is located in the<span class="tooltip">area of great volcanic activity encircling the Pacific Ocean<span class="tooltiptext">the Ring of Fire</span></span>.
</p>

<p>Under the Pacific Ocean is the largest of the<span class="tooltip">gigantic slabs of solid rock<span class="tooltiptext">tectonic plates</span></span> that make up the Earth's crust.
</p>

<p>Wherever the Pacific plate <span class="tooltip">runs into<span class="tooltiptext">collides with</span></span> other plates, there are huge forces at work.
</p>

<p><span class="tooltip">The area where two tectonic plates come together<span class="tooltiptext">the plate boundary</span></span> is where earthquakes happen.
</p>

<p><span class="tooltip">Cone-shaped mountains that release lava, ash, and gas <span class="tooltiptext">volcanoes</span></span> are found here.
</p>

<p><span class="tooltip">Releasing lava, ash, and gas<span class="tooltiptext">erupting</span></span> can be violent.
</p>

<p>Lava, as you may already know, is <span class="tooltip">liquid<span class="tooltiptext">molten</span></span> rock.
</p>

<p>There are many volcanoes in the Ring of Fire that <span class="tooltip">have not erupted during historical times<span class="tooltiptext">extinct</span></span>.
</p>

<p>Many <span class="tooltip">have been inactive for a long time but could erupt again.<span class="tooltiptext">dormant</span></span>
</p>

<p>Some of the volcanoes in the Ring of Fire are<span class="tooltip">currently erupting or have recently erupted<span class="tooltiptext">active</span></span>.
</p>

<p>There are two ways a volcano can release <span class="tooltip">liquid rock<span class="tooltiptext">lava</span></span>.
</p>

<p>One way is for the lava to erupt from the<span class="tooltip">large, bowl-shaped hole forming a volcano's mouth<span class="tooltiptext">crater</span></span>.
</p>

<p>Another way is for the lava to erupt through a<span class="tooltip">crack on the side of a volcano<span class="tooltiptext">fissure</span></span>.
