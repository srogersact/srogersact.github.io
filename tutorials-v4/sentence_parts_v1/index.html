<h3>Look at a few ways this sentence can be rearranged:</h3>

<p>
<span class="subject">Opal</span>
<span class="conjunction">and</span>
<span class="subject">the preacher</span>  
<span class="predicate">moved</span>
<span class="where"> to Naomi, Florida, </span>
<span class="when">that summer</span>.
<!-- <span class="why">so the preacher could be the new preacher at the Open Arms Baptist Church of Naomi</span> -->

</p>


<p><b>Did you notice that the sentence has two subjects? It's called a "compound subject" sentence.
<br>Here's another arrangement of the sentence:</b></p>

<p>
<span class="subject">The preacher</span>
<span class="conjunction">and</span>
<span class="subject">Opal</span>  
<span class="predicate">moved</span>
<span class="where"> to Naomi, Florida, </span>
<span class="when">that summer</span>.
<!-- <span class="why">so the preacher could be the new preacher at the Open Arms Baptist Church of Naomi</span> -->

</p>

<p><b>Did you see that the only difference was the order of the two subjects?
<br>
<br>Here is another arrangement of the sentence:</b></p>

<p>
<span class="when">That summer</span>
<span class="subject">the preacher</span>
<span class="conjunction">and</span>
<span class="subject">Opal</span>  
<span class="predicate">moved</span>
<span class="where"> to Naomi, Florida</span>.
<!-- <span class="why">so the preacher could be the new preacher at the Open Arms Baptist Church of Naomi</span> -->
