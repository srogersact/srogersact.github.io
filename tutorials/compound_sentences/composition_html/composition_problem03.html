      Remember, here is what you do to compose a compound sentence from three or more sentences:
        <ul>
          <li>Change the periods at the ends of the sentences into commas&mdash;except for the period at the end of the very last sentence. </li>
          <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> before the very last sentence.  </li>
          <li>Make sure you don't have capitals in the middle of your sentence if they don't need to be there.</li>
          <li>Remember the <span class="tooltip">Oxford comma<span class="tooltiptext">The comma before the conjunction.</span></span>!</li>
