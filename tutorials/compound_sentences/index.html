<!-- Introduction -->
<p>Learning about compound sentences is a great place to begin thinking about grammar effects, because analyzing and composing compound sentences is so easy! </p>


<!-- Special Note -->
  <div class="defining_text" >
  In this work...
    <ul>
      <li>When you <em>analyze</em> a sentence, you will break it into simple sentences.</li>
      <li>When you <em>compose</em> a sentence, you will join simple sentences together to make a more complicated sentence.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
<br>


<!-- Analysis 1 -->
<br>
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing a Compound Sentence</h2>

  <p>Here is a compound sentence:</p> 

        <p class="problem">Egypt is a country in Africa, and Greece is a country in Europe.</p>

  <p>This sentence can easily be analyzed as two sentences. 
 
  <br>You simply... 
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Remove the <span class="tooltip">conjunction:<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>  </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>


        <p class="solution">Egypt is a country in Africa. Greece is a country in Europe.</p>

  <p>That is super easy, don't you think? 
  <br>
  <br>Here is another very simple example:</p> 

        <p class="problem">Upper Egypt is in the south,  <span class="tooltip">and<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction.</span></span> Lower Egypt is in the north.</p>

  <br>
  <p> Again, you just...
    <ul>
        <li>Change the comma into a period. </li>
        <li>Remove the <span class="tooltip">conjunction:<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>  </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

        <p class="solution">Upper Egypt is in the south. Lower Egypt is in the north.</p>

<!-- Composition 1 -->
<br>
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-1&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing a Compound Sentence</h2>

  <p>Here are two sentences:</p> 

        <p class="problem">Memphis was an important city in Egypt. Athens was an important city in Greece.</p>

  <p>These sentences can easily be composed as one compound sentence. 
  <br>
    <p> Here is what you do:
      <ul>
          <li>Change the period at the end of the first sentence into a comma. </li>
          <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction.<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>  </li>
          <li>Make sure you don't have capitals in the middle of your sentence if they don't need to be there.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

        <p class="solution">Memphis was an important city in Egypt, and Athens was an important city in Greece.</p>

  <p>That is super easy, too, don't you think? 
  <br>
  <br>Here is another example:</p> 

        <p class="problem">The Ionian Sea is to the west of mainland Greece. The Aegean Sea is to the east of mainland Greece.</p>

  <p>These are longer sentences. Do they make you nervous? Just remember these simple directions:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the period at the end of the first sentence into a comma. </li>
        <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction.<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span>  </li>
        <li>Make sure you don't have capitals in the middle of your sentence if they don't need to be there.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

        <p class="solution">The Ionian Sea is to the west of mainland Greece, and the Aegean Sea is to the east of mainland Greece.</p>

  <p>We changed the period to a comma.
  <br>
  <br>We added "and".
  <br>
  <br>Did you notice that we also made the "t" in "the" lowercase?

<br>
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;A-2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing Compound Sentences with Three or More Clauses</h2>

  <p>Sometimes a sentence has three or more <span class="tooltip">clauses.<span class="tooltiptext">A clause is a part of a sentence that can stand by itself as a complete sentence.</span></span>:</p> 

        <p class="problem">Cyprus is an island north of Egypt, Crete is an island close to mainland Greece, and Sicily is an island south of Rome.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The first clause is <span class="problem_quote"> Cyprus is an island north of Egypt.</span></li>
        <li>The second clause is <span class="problem_quote"> Crete is an island close to mainland Greece.</span></li>
        <li>The third clause is <span class="problem_quote"> Sicily is an island south of Rome.</span></li>
       </ul>

    <p>Now it is easy to see that the compound sentence was really just a list of sentences. </p>
    <p>A compound sentence with three or more clauses is easy to analyze:
    
      <ul>
        <li>Change the commas into periods. </li>
        <li>Remove the conjunction. </li>
        <li>Make sure your sentences start with capitals.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

        <p class="solution">Cyprus is an island north of Egypt. Crete is an island close to mainland Greece. Sicily is an island south of Rome.</p>

  <p>A sentence can have four, five, or more sentences.
  <br>If you focus on just one of those sentences at a time, it will be easier to understand.

<br>
<h2><span style="color:oldlace;font-weight:bolder;background:black">&nbsp;C-2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing Compound Sentences with Three or More Clauses</h2>

  <p>Sometimes you have three or more sentences that go together:</p> 

        <p class="problem">Menes founded Memphis. Theseus founded Athens. Romulus founded Rome.</p>

  <p>It is easy to compose a compound sentence using these three sentences 
  <br>
  <p> Here is what you do:
      <ul>
          <li>Change the periods at the ends of the sentences into commas&mdash;except for the period at the end of the very last sentence. </li>
          <li>Add a <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> before the very last sentence.  </li>
          <li>Make sure you don't have capitals in the middle of your sentence if they don't need to be there.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

        <p class="solution">Menes founded Memphis, Theseus founded Athens, and Romulus founded Rome.</p>

  <p>Notice that we use commas where the first two periods went. 
  <br>
  <!-- Special Note -->
  <div class="defining_text" >
  Use the Oxford Comma:
    <ul>
      <li>In this work you will always put a comma before the <span class="tooltip">conjunction<span class="tooltiptext">"And" is a conjunction--and so are "but" and "or."</span></span> at the end of a list.</li>
      <li>This is what is called the <em>"Oxford comma."</em></li>
      <li>Some people prefer to leave out the Oxford comma. That's perfectly okay.</li>
      <li><em>BUT you will have to use the Oxford comma in the "Try It Yourself" exercises.</em> Otherwise, they won't work.</li>      
    </ul>
