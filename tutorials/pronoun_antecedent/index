A Dying King Sends for His Sons
Darius the king of Persia and the queen, Parysatis, had two sons: Artaxerxes and his younger brother, Cyrus. When Darius was sick and suspected that he was about to die, he wanted both of his sons to be with him. Artaxerxes happened to be at the palace already, but his younger brother was far away and had to be sent for.  Cyrus was the satrap (governor) of a satrapy (province) that his father had given him. His father had also made him general of the armies that are gathered in the plain of Castolus. When Cyrus received the message, he traveled to where his father was. He took along Tissaphernes, whom he thought was his friend. He also took along three hundred heavily armed Greek soldiers, or “hoplites,” and their commander, Xenias the Parrhasian.

Cyrus Is Arrested and Released
Darius died and Artaxerxes became king. Then Tissaphernes told Artaxerxes that his brother was plotting against him. When Artaxerxes heard Tissaphernes’ accusation, he had Cyrus arrested and was about to have him executed.  Their mother, though, begged for Cyrus’ life and sent him back safely to his province.
