<h2>Chapter 1:  Cyrus Gathers An Army</h2>
<h3>§1:  A Dying King Sends for His Sons</h3>
<p>Darius the king of Persia and the queen, Parysatis, had two sons: Artaxerxes and his younger brother, Cyrus. When Darius was sick and suspected that he was about to die, he wanted both of his sons to be with him. Artaxerxes happened to be at the palace already, but his younger brother was far away and had to be sent for.  Cyrus was the satrap (governor) of a satrapy (province) that his father had given him. His father had also made him general of the armies that are gathered in the plain of Castolus. When Cyrus received the message, he traveled to where his father was. He took along Tissaphernes, whom he thought was his friend. He also took along three hundred heavily armed Greek soldiers, or “hoplites,” and their commander, Xenias the Parrhasian.</p>

<h3>§2:  Cyrus Is Arrested and Released</h3>
<p>Darius died and Artaxerxes became king. Then Tissaphernes told Artaxerxes that his brother was plotting against him. When Artaxerxes heard Tissaphernes’ accusation, he had Cyrus arrested and was about to have him executed.  Their mother, though, begged for Cyrus’ life and sent him back safely to his province. </p>

<h3>§3:  Cyrus Plots Against His Brother and Wins Persian Support</h3>
<p>This was not only a narrow escape for Cyrus, but also a dishonor. So he decided he would do his best never to be in his brother’s power again and began to plan how he could become king instead.  Right from the first, his mother, Parysatis, was on his side because she loved Cyrus more than Artaxerxes. Cyrus also won over the people from the king’s court whenever they visited him.  Additionally, he trained the barbarian soldiers under his command so that they would be skillful warriors and loyal to himself. Lastly, he began to gather a Greek army—secretly, though, so that he could take the king by surprise.</p>

<h3>§4:  He Recruits a Greek Army and Besieges Miletus</h3>
<p>This is how he went about it. There were some cities in Ionia that the king had given to Tissaphernes. These cities rebelled against him and made Cyrus their governor instead.  So Cyrus gave orders for the commander of the troops in each city to hire the best Peloponnesian mercenaries they could find. His excuse was that Tissaphernes was plotting against the cities. Another Ionian city, Miletus, also tried to rebel against Tissaphernes.  He found out about it, though, and executed some of the people who had plotted against him and sent the rest into exile. So here was another excuse Cyrus could use to raise an army, because he gathered the people in exile from Miletus and formed an army out of them. Then they besieged Miletus by land and sea to try to get back into their city.</p>

<h3>§5:  He Fools the King</h3>
<p>While this was going on, Cyrus sent a message to Artaxerxes and requested that he, as the king's brother, be made governor of the Ionian cities instead of Tissaphernes. The queen helped Cyrus fool his brother, so that the king could not tell that his younger brother was plotting against him. Artaxerxes thought Cyrus was buying weapons and hiring soldiers so he could make war on Tissaphernes. Nor did it bother him too much to see those two at war with each other, especially since Cyrus made sure the king got the payments due to him from the cities that had belonged to Tissaphernes.</p>

<h3>§6:  Clearchus Recruits a Third Army on the Chersonese</h3>
<p>A third army was recruited for him on the Chersonese, across from Abydos, in the following way.  Clearchus was an exile from Sparta. Cyrus became friends with him and admired him. He gave Clearchus a huge amount of gold—ten thousand darics—as a gift. Clearchus used that money to raise an army to defend the Greeks against the Thracians to their north. The cities on the Chersonese that he defended were so thankful that they contributed even more money to support the troops. So this was another way in which Cyrus kept an army ready for use.</p>

<h3>§7:  Aristippus Recruits a Fourth Army and Gets More Than He Asked For</h3>
<p>Cyrus had another friend named Aristippus. This man had some enemies at home in Thessaly who were making things difficult for him. So Aristippus came to Cyrus and asked him for enough money to hire two thousand mercenaries for three months. That way, he said, he could get the best of his rivals.  Instead, Cyrus gave him six months’ pay for four thousand mercenaries. The only condition was that Aristippus had to agree not to make up with his enemies before talking to Cyrus about it. So this was a fourth secret army.</p>

<h3>§8:  Other Greek Generals Gather Armies</h3>
<p>He had other friends recruit armies for him, too. To one he said that he wanted help fighting the Pisidians. He told two others that he would like them to gather an army to help him fight Tissaphernes with the Milesian exiles.</p>
